Tools to help you figure out what is going on in your triggers.

== Overview

Beat Link Trigger offers a few mechanisms to help you understand how
your triggers are (or are not) working, and to save and restore
versions of them, or share them with friends and colleagues (or
on the https://gitter.im/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger[Gitter chat]
or https://github.com/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger/wiki[project Wiki]
to either get help from others, or share and show them off).

== Logs

When Beat Link Trigger is running it reports events to a log file. As
noted above, this includes full stack traces for compilation problems
when you try to save an expression that isn't quite right. If a
problem occurs while trying to run your expression later, that will
end up in the log too. So it can be a useful place to look when things
are not working the way you expect. You can find the log file by using
the Open Logs Folder option in the File menu.

Each time you launch Beat Link Trigger it creates a new log folder in
a temporary directory, so that they can be cleaned up automatically
sometime after it exits. It cycles through log files and limits their
maximum length, which can be important if an error is being logged
each time a packet comes in because of a problematic Enabled Filter
expression.

Even if things are not crashing, you might want to log your own
information to get a better understanding of what is happening inside
one of your expressions. Beat Link Trigger uses
https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre[timbre] to perform its logging,
and so can you.

For example, if you are trying to figure out exactly what you are
receiving in your Beat expression, you could add this as its first
line:

```clojure
(timbre/info "Received beat" status "master?" tempo-master?)
```

Suddenly your logs will be growing steadily, filling with lines like these:

```
2016-Jun-05 00:12:10 Alacrity.local INFO [beat-link-trigger.expressions:?] -
  Received beat Beat: Device 2, name: CDJ-2000nexus, pitch: +0.00%,
  track BPM: 126.0, effective BPM: 126.0, beat within bar: 4 master? true
2016-Jun-05 00:12:11 Alacrity.local INFO [beat-link-trigger.expressions:?] -
  Received beat Beat: Device 33, name: DJM-2000nexus, pitch: +0.00%,
  track BPM: 126.0, effective BPM: 126.0, beat within bar: 1 master? false
```

== Inspecting Locals and Globals

In addition to logging values to the log file, you can get a glimpse
at what your expressions are up to by opening an inspector window on
the Expression Globals or a particular trigger's Expression Locals.
The first is done by choosing Inspect Expression Globals in the
Triggers menu. It opens a window showing you all the keys and values
that have been created in the `globals` atom shared by all triggers.
Here is what that looks like after the example code shown in the
<<Expressions#global-expressions,Global Expressions section>> has run:

image:assets/ExpressionGlobals.png[Expression Globals,872,462]

The inspector is a little messy, but right away you can see the three
keys we created, and the corresponding Java objects stored under them.
by clicking next to the blue diamond in the lower pane, you can expand
each entry and dive down into the fields and values that make it up,
which can be quite a powerful way to explore the objects.

Similarly, the locals for a trigger can be inspected by choosing
Inspect Expression Locals from that trigger's context menu. Here's the
result of drilling down a little into the `:resolume` OSC client
object created in that example's trigger:

image:assets/ExpressionLocals.png[Expression Locals,789,626]

== Saving and Loading

The entire trigger configuration can be saved to a text file by
choosing Save in the File menu. That file can be sent to another
machine, shared with a colleague, or just kept around for future use
after you are done with a different project. As you would expect, the
Load option replaces the current trigger configuration with one loaded
from a save file.

=== Exporting and Importing Triggers

As mentioned in the <<Triggers#context-menu,Context Menu>> section,
individual triggers can be exported on their own, and imported into
other trigger configurations.

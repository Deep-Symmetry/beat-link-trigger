== Startup

When you first open Beat Link Trigger, it tries to find the Pro DJ
Link devices that you want it to monitor. If it can't find any, after
ten seconds you will see this window:

image:assets/NoDevices.png[No devices found]

If you were expecting to find devices, double-check that they are
powered on, and properly networked with your computer (and that any
hub or wireless router you are using is also properly turned on and
configured). Then click kbd:[Try Again] to try again.

If you just wanted to work on setting up your triggers or expressions,
and don't have any actual players handy, you can also click
kbd:[Continue Offline] to work in an offline mode. Your triggers won't
actually fire, but you can do all the configuration and editing that
you need.

Once a device is found, or you choose to continue offline, the Trigger
window opens, in the same configuration that you left it the last time
you used the program.

== Triggers

Each row in the Trigger window defines a single trigger, which watches
a player or category of players, and can be configured to send
different messages in response to what the player is doing.

If this is the first time you have opened Beat Link Trigger, you will
see just one trigger containing default options.

To create additional triggers you can choose `New Trigger` in the
`Triggers` menu, or type kbd:[⌘+T] (on the Mac) or kbd:[Ctrl+T] (on
other platforms). You can get back to this default state at any time
by choosing `Clear Triggers` in the `Triggers` menu.

Here are the sections of a trigger, and how they work:

=== Comment

The Comment field is a free-form text area you can use to describe the
purpose of the trigger, to remind you when you later come back to it.
Apart from the trigger index, a number by which Beat Link Trigger
identifies the trigger when it is reporting errors or naming related
windows (like expression editors, described below), the comment takes
up the entire width of the first line of the trigger row.

=== Watch Menu

The Watch menu tells the trigger what player(s) it should pay
attention to. It lets you choose Player&nbsp;1 through Player&nbsp;4,
as well as two dynamic choices.

image:assets/WatchMenu.png[Watch Menu, 810]

NOTE: If a player is chosen which is not currently present on the
network, the player will be reported “not found”, and the trigger will
not operate until either the player reappears, or a different player
is chosen. Of course when you are working in Offline mode, all players
will be missing and the trigger will simply say “Offline”.

Any Player:: If you choose to watch Any Player, then just as you would
expect, the trigger will respond to activity on any player in the
network. It will track whatever player seems “best” at the moment: If
there is an Enabled condition which causes the trigger to be enabled
for some players and not for others, it will watch the players that
enable it. Within that group, if some players are playing and others
are not, it will watch the ones that are playing. Finally, if there
are still multiple players to choose between, it will pick the
lowest-numbered one.

Master Player:: If you choose to watch the Master Player, the trigger
will focus on whichever player is the current Tempo (sync) Master.

Right after the Watch menu, the trigger row displays the player number
and latest status received from the watched player, if one was found.

=== MIDI Output Menu

The MIDI Output Menu lets you choose the MIDI device to which the
trigger will send messages. It will show all MIDI outputs currently
available on your system.

image:assets/MidiMenu.png[MIDI Output Menu, 810]

NOTE: If a MIDI Output is chosen which is no longer available on the
system (as shown in trigger 3 above), it will remain in that row's
menu, but the Enabled section of the trigger will be replaced with the
message “Not found.” Once the output reappears, or a different output
is chosen, the trigger will become fully operational again.

=== Message Menu

The Message Menu determines what kind of MIDI message is sent by the
trigger.

image:assets/MessageMenu.png[Message Menu, 814]

Note:: With this setting, the trigger sends a Note On message, with
the velocity shown to the right of the menu, when the watched player
starts playing (as long as the trigger is enabled), and a Note Off
message when the watched player stops or the trigger is disabled.

CC:: With this setting, the trigger sends a Control Change message,
with the value shown to the right of the menu, when the watched player
starts playing (as long as the trigger is enabled), and sends a CC
with value 0 when the player stops or the trigger is disabled.

Clock:: With this setting, the trigger sends MIDI Beat Clock messages
whenever the trigger is enabled, to synchronize the tempo of the
target device with the tempo reported by the watched player. If the
check box to the right of the menu is checked, it will either send a
Start or Continue message (as chosen in the following menu) when the
watched player starts playing, and if the Stop box is checked, it will
send a Stop message when the watched player stops.

Custom:: When this option is chosen, the trigger will not send any
messages on its own, and it is up to you to send them in code you
write in the trigger expressions, as described below. This gives you
the most flexibility because in addition to MIDI messages, you can
send arbitrary UDP packets, HTTP requests, or whatever you might need.

=== Velocity/Value Spinner

Immediately to the right of the Message Menu (unless MIDI Beat Clock
is chosen as the Message type), this lets you set the MIDI Velocity
for Note On messages, or the controller value for Control Change
messages, if those Message options are chosen. The value chosen here
is sent when the trigger is enabled and the watched player starts
playing. The value is also available to your trigger expressions if
they want to use it.

=== Channel Spinner

For triggers sending anything but MIDI Beat Clock, this lets you
specify the MIDI channel on which messages are sent.

=== Enabled Menu

The Enabled menu controls when the trigger will respond to the watched
player starting or stopping playback.

image:assets/EnabledMenu.png[Enabled Menu, 814]

Always:: With this setting, the trigger is enabled until you disable
it.

Never:: With this setting, the trigger is disabled until you re-enable
it.

On-Air:: With this setting, the trigger is enabled whenever the
watched player reports that it is On the Air. (For that to work, the
player must be connected to a Nexus mixer, and must have the feature
turned on.)

Custom:: With this setting, the trigger is controlled by an Enabled
Filter expression that you write yourself. Whenever a status update is
received from any watched player, your expression is called. If it
returns a `true` value, the trigger will be enabled. This lets you
apply sophisticated logic, like enabling the trigger when a particular
track number is loaded into the player, and it has reached a
particular beat during playback. Expressions are further explained
below. If you choose Custom and have not yet written an Enabled Filter
expression, the expression editor will be opened to let you do that.

=== Trigger Status

To the right of the Enabled menu there is a Trigger Status indicator
which shows whether the trigger is currently enabled (a green circle)
or disabled (a red circle with a slash). If the player is currently
playing, there is a filled circle inside the enabled circle:

[width="50%",cols=".^,.^",options="header"]

=== Context Menu

Each trigger row has a context menu attached to it, which can be
accessed by right-clicking (or control-clicking) anywhere on the row's
background, but you can also open the context menu with a regular
mouse click on the button with a gear icon in it. Most of the menu is
devoted to editing various expressions to customize the trigger, as
described below. The gear icon next to an expression will be filled in
if that expression has a value, and the gear in the button will be
filled in if any expression associated with the trigger has a value.

image:assets/ContextMenu.png[Context Menu, 254]

Below the expression-related options, you can export the current
trigger configuration to a text file which can be imported into a
different trigger or shared with colleagues, and you can delete the
trigger, unless it is the only remaining trigger in the window.

== Expressions

A great deal of the power of Beat Link Trigger is in what you can do
with custom expressions.

WARNING: If you are playing with this already, please be aware it
is not finished, and you are getting a sneak preview with no

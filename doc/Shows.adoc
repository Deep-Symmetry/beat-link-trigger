Watch for beat ranges of specific tracks to be played, and send things
like MIDI or OSC messages in response.

== Overview

Version 0.5 of Beat Link Trigger introduced a major new set of user
interface features called the Show interface, which make it far easier
to match tracks, and cause things to happen when particular beat
ranges in those tracks are played.

All of these things could be done before the Show interface (and
several people put together quite sophisticated shows) using basic
Triggers, but they involved writing a great many custom Expressions to
match the tracks and watch for the right beats, and were very tedious
to figure out, requiring lots of time hooked up to CDJs during the
design process.

Also, there is a practical limit to how many Triggers you can have in
your file, because each one gets considered in sequence whenever a
packet is received from a player. The limit may be a few dozen, or
many more, but eventually your CPU will be get busy just evaluating
triggers. The Show interface doesn't have this limitation--it uses a
sophisticated and efficient mechanism for recognizing tracks, and
allows you to add thousands of tracks to your Shows. Tracks in a Show
will not put any load on your CPU until they are actually loaded in a
player.

Finally, because tracks can be added to a Show either from players on
the network, or by reading them directly from your rekordbox USB or SD
media, you can set up your Shows, draw cues on the tracks' beat grids,
with reference to their waveforms, and configure the messages you want
the cues to send, even in situations where you don't have access to
CDJs. Almost all of the Show interface features are fully functional
when Beat Link Trigger is operating in Offline mode, and the ones that
don't make sense are simply hidden from view. This supports a flexible
and convenient workflow.

== Creating a Show

To use the Show interface, you start by choosing menu:File[New Show]
in the Beat Link Triggers window.

This opens a Save dialog where you choose the location and name of
your new Show file. Navigate to where you would like to keep it, type
a name, and click kbd:[Save].

image:assets/NewShow2.png[New Show Save dialog,660,460]

Beat Link Trigger will create a new, empty Show file for you with your
chosen name, and open its window. If you quit with a Show window open,
it will automatically be reopened the next time you start the program.
You can have multiple Show windows open at the same time, in case you
want to organize your cues into separate groups for controlling
different kinds of integrations (such as perhaps laser cues in one
Show, and video cues in another) and each one will be reopened
automatically and run independently. You can tailor which Shows you
open based on which hardware is being used for a given performance.

=== Show Window Header Elements

At the top of the Show window, above any Tracks that you have added to
it, is a header that allows you to configure the default Enabled
filter (explained below), and to filter which Tracks are currently
visible, which is helpful when you have added a lot of them to the
Show.

If you type any text in the `Filter` box, only tracks that match that
text will be visible. Similarly, if you check the `Loaded Only`
checkbox, only tracks that are currently loaded on a player on the
network will be visible. This is a great way to narrow down your focus
to watch what is going on with tracks the DJ is currently playing.

TIP: The `Loaded Only` checkbox is only visible when Beat Link Trigger
is Online, because otherwise there is no way tracks could be
identified as loaded.

=== Adding Tracks to a Show

Shows don't do anything until they include at least one Track. There
are a number of different ways you can add Tracks to your Show. Most
of them can be found by choosing menu:Tracks[Import Track] in the Show
window menu bar:

image:assets/ImportTrack.png[Import Track menu,793,418]

If you are currently Online, and there are any players on the network
that have rekordbox tracks loaded that are not already part of the
Show, you will see them as options in the menu. Choosing
menu:Tracks[Import Track>from Player 2] (for example) will download
that track from the player, and add everthing needed to work with the
it to the Show file (the elements of a Track row are explained below,
after the other ways of adding them to a Show).

image:assets/FirstTrackLoaded.png[First track loaded into Show,1009,466]

To help avoid confusion, rather than simply having the player
disappear from the list of import choices if the track it has loaded
is already part of the Show, the menu option is disabled and an
explanation is added:

image:assets/ImportTrackAlready.png[Track already in Show,1009,466]

To make it possible to set up your Show even when you don't have
access to your player network, you can also import Tracks directly
from rekordbod USB or SD media. To do that, mount the media on your
computer, and choose menu:Tracks[Import Track>from Offline Media]. An
Choose Media dialog will appear, from which you can navigate to the
media:

image:assets/ChooseMedia.png[Choose Media dialog,526,369]

Once you click kbd:[Choose Media], the exported database is parsed,
and a Choose Track window is presented, which is very similar to the
<<Players#loading-playing,Loading and Playing Tracks>> interface
offered by the Player Status window (see that section for details
about how to navigate the interface and use the Search feature):

image:assets/ShowChooseTrack.png[Choose Track dialog,720,518]

Once you have found the Track you are looking for, click kbd:[Choose
Track] to add it to the Show.

image:assets/SecondTrackLoaded.png[Second track loaded into Show,1005,589]

TIP: To save time, once you have chosen media to load tracks from
during a Beat Link Trigger session, your media choice is remembered
(and the parsed database export is kept open), so the next time you
choose to import from offline media, the media selection window is
skipped and you are taken right to the track selection window. If you
want to import from different media, click the kbd:[Change Media]
button at the bottom of the window. This also means you will not be
able to eject the media on most operating systems because BLT has it
open; if you do need to eject it without quitting BLT, choose
menu:Tracks[Import Track>from Offline Media], click kbd:[Change
Media], and it will be closed so you can eject it. At that point you
can click kbd:[Cancel] if you did not actually want to import a Track.

The final way to add a Track to a Show is to copy it from another
Show. When you have multiple Show windows open, you can copy Tracks
from one to another by finding the Track in the open Show that already
contains it, then choosing menu:Copy to Show “<name>”[] in the Track's
context menu:

image:assets/CopyTrack.png[Copy Track to Show,1005,625]

TIP: If you don't see an open Show in the `Copy to` list, that means
the Track is already present in the other Show.

=== Track Row Elements

Tracks are kept sorted alpahabetically by title and artist in the Show
window (and remember that you can narrow the display to show only
those matching a string you time in the `Filter` field). If there is
album art available, it is shown at the top left. To the right of that
is a column that shows the track title, artist, a comment field, and
information about which players have the track loaded, and which are
currently playing it.

The comment field starts out holding whatever comment the DJ entered
about the track in rekordbox, but you are free to edit it however you
like, to help you remember things about the track or to make it easy
to find using the `Filter` field.

The waveform preview section shows the overall intensity and dominant
frequencies of the track from beginning to end. As in the Player
Status window, you can see the locations of hot cues and memory points
in the waveform preview, and if any players have the track loaded, you
can see their playback position markers. (Unlike in the Player Status
window, you may see more than one player position on a single track,
because the same track might be loaded in more than one player.)

_This section needs to be finished, and a lot of new screen shots
taken!_

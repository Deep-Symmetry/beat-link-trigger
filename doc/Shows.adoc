Watch for beat ranges of specific tracks to be played, and send things
like MIDI or OSC messages in response.

== Overview

Version 0.5 of Beat Link Trigger introduced a major new set of user
interface features called the Show interface, which make it far easier
to match tracks, and cause things to happen when particular beat
ranges in those tracks are played.

All of these things could be done before the Show interface (and
several people put together quite sophisticated shows) using basic
Triggers, but they involved writing a great many custom Expressions to
match the tracks and watch for the right beats, and were very tedious
to figure out, requiring lots of time hooked up to CDJs during the
design process.

Also, there is a practical limit to how many Triggers you can have in
your file, because each one gets considered in sequence whenever a
packet is received from a player. The limit may be a few dozen, or
many more, but eventually your CPU will be get busy just evaluating
triggers. The Show interface doesn't have this limitation--it uses a
sophisticated and efficient mechanism for recognizing tracks, and
allows you to add thousands of tracks to your shows. Tracks in a show
will not put any load on your CPU until they are actually loaded in a
player.

Finally, because tracks can be added to a show either from players on
the network, or by reading them directly from your rekordbox USB or SD
media, you can set up your shows, draw cues on the tracks' beat grids,
with reference to their waveforms, and configure the messages you want
the cues to send, even in situations where you don't have access to
CDJs. Almost all of the Show interface features are fully functional
when Beat Link Trigger is operating in Offline mode, and the ones that
don't make sense are simply hidden from view. This supports a flexible
and convenient workflow.

taken!_

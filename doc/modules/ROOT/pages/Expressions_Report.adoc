= Expressions Report
include::partial$PagePreamble.adoc[]

A show can end up containing a great many
<<Expressions.adoc#,Expressions>> as it grows: they can be attached to
the <<Expressions_ShowShared.adoc#,show itself>>,
<<Expressions_ShowTrack.adoc#,tracks>>,
<<Expressions_PhraseTrigger.adoc#,phrase triggers>>, and
<<Expressions_ShowCue.adoc#,cues>> within the tracks and phrase
triggers. Finding and keeping track of them all using only the editor
windows accessed through context menus would be a significant
challenge, which is why the Expressions Report was added.

NOTE: Though the expressions report mechanism was created for shows, it was later extended to the <<Triggers.adoc#,Triggers>> window as well.
You can now create a report about that window's <<Expressions_TriggerGlobal.adoc#,global expressions>> and the expressions belonging to each <<Expressions_Trigger.adoc#,trigger>> through the Triggers window menu:File[] menu.
It has the same features and capabilities as reports for shows.

The report is broken down into sections.
At the top the expressions which apply to the show as a whole.
These are followed by expressions at the track level for each track that has them, and then for each cue within that track that has expressions.
Then any phrase triggers with expressions are listed, followed by any cues within the phrase triggers which have their own expressions.
Finally, any expressions belonging to <<Shows_RawTriggers.adoc#,Raw Triggers>> from the show are listed, even though they appear in the Triggers window while the show is open.

Each expression in the report shows the expression type (if you hover
the mouse pointer over the title, a description of the purpose of that
expression is shown), followed by some action buttons, and the code of
the expression as it existed when the report was generated. (The code
is truncated for compactness, but if you hover the mouse over it, you
can see the full content).

TIP: If an expression is currently being ignored because of the
configuration of the show, a red note is shown beneath the title
explaining this.

The action buttons let you edit the expression (the pencil) or
simulate it (the play button) if that makes sense for the expression
type. Clicking the pencil will tell Beat Link Trigger to open the
editor window for that expression, or bring it to the front if it was
already open. (If you are editing a cue expression, the Cues Editor
window for that track or phrase trigger will also be opened if it
wasn’t already.)

NOTE: The action buttons will only work if you have enabled report
actions in the <<Shows.adoc#show-menu-bar,show menu bar>>. The report
will remind you of this if you try to use one and you haven’t yet
enabled them.

The simulate (play) buttons will run the version of the expression
that was most recently saved, which might be different from what is
shown in the report if you haven’t refreshed it recently, and might be
different from the expression editor window if that is open and
contains unsaved changes.

## Navigation

You can find expressions by using your browser’s text search feature
(which is especially helpful if you are hunting for a piece of code
you want to reuse in a different expression). But you can also jump to
a particular section of the report using the
menu:View in Expression Report[] option in any
<<Expressions.adoc#editor-menus,expression
editor context menu>>, and the context menus of
<<Shows_Tracks.adoc#track-context-menu,tracks>>,
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#context-menu,phrase triggers>>, and
<<Shows_Cues.adoc#cue-context-menu,cues>>.
This offers a convenient way of seeing all the related expressions in
one place, and simulating them in sequence to validate how they will
behave in an actual performance.

You can also navigate the other direction by clicking the gear button
that appears at the end of each section title in the report. That will
bring the <<Shows.adoc#show-window-header-elements,show window>> to
the front for the show-level expressions. For a track section, in
addition to doing that, it will scroll that <<Shows_Tracks.adoc#,track
row>> into view. For a phrase trigger section it will do the same with
the <<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#,phrase trigger row>>. And for a cue
section, it will open (or bring to the front) the appropriate Cues
Editor window, and scroll the right
<<Shows_Cues.adoc#cue-row-elements,cue row>> into view.

Navigating back and forth like this can turn the expressions report
into a powerful way to build and validate a related set of
expressions, even in a large show.

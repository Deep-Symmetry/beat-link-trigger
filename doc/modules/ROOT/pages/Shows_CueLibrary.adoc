= The Cue Library
include::partial$PagePreamble.adoc[]

When building a show with a group of tracks, there will often be a
shared set of lighting looks or presets that will be useful in more
than one track. Once you have set up a cue that sends the proper
messages to achieve that look, you can make it available for reuse
in any track by adding it to the Cue Library. To do that, choose
menu:Add Cue to Library[] from the Cue
<<Shows_Cues.adoc#cue-context-menu,context menu.>>

[[cue-library-button]]
As soon as you have a cue in the show's library, a kbd:[Library ▾]
button appears next to the kbd:[New Cue] button in any Cue Editor
windows you have open for tracks in the show. Clicking it gives you
a menu of all the cues that you have added to the show's library, and
choosing one creates a new cue (in the same location that the
kbd:[New Cue] button would), based on the template cue that you put
in the library:

TIP: The names that appear in the Cue Library are the names (comments)
of the cues that have been added to it, so it makes sense to make sure
your cue is well named before adding it to the library.

Another way to choose a cue template from the library is to right-click
(or control-click) anywhere outside an existing cue in the waveform
at the top of the Cue Editor window:

Using either of those approaches to choose menu:New “Red Wash” Cue[] in
the menu would result in the creation of a cue based on that template
in the selected region of the track:

The new cue will share any of the MIDI message configurations and
Expressions that were present in the cue that was added to the show
library.

[[updating-library]]
== Updating the Library

If you already have a cue in the library, you  can update its content
by changing the cue that it was based on, and then using the cue
context menu again. When there is already a cue with a particular
name in the library, instead of seeing Add Cue to Library, the
option will read menu:Update Cue in Library[]. Choosing that will
replace the cue template with the MIDI and Expression settings of the
current cue. (This will not change any cues that you already created
based on the template, but it will change any future cues you create
from it.)

If the current cue has exactly the same content as the cue of the
same name in the library (ignoring incidental details like its
position in the track or displayed hue), the menu option will read
menu:Remove Cue from Library[], and choosing it will do just that.

[[cue-library-folders]]
== Cue Library Folders

If you collect a large number of cues in your library, the menu can
get inconveniently large and make it hard to find the cue you are
looking for. You can avoid that problem by organizing your cues into
folders. At the bottom of the <<cue-library-button,Library button
menu>> there is a menu:Manage Folders[] submenu.

When you have no folders, the only option in that menu is
menu:New Folder[]. Choosing it opens up a dialog in which you can enter
the name of the folder you would like to create:

As soon as you have created a folder, the menus for choosing library
cues (both in the Library button and in the waveform context menu)
expand to show all the folders as submenus before the non-folder cues:

The context menu option for adding a cue to the library also
transforms into a submenu allowing you to choose whether you want to
add it to a folder or to the top level of the library.

TIP: If you have existing cues in the library that you would like to
move into folders, follow the steps described
<<updating-library,above>> to remove them from the library and re-add
them into the desired folder.

Once you have organized your cues into folders, finding and picking
them out of the appropriate submenu can be easier and faster than
scrolling through a single giant menu.

Once you have folders, the menu:Manage Folders[] menu also allows you
to rename or remove them. Removing a folder moves any cues you placed
inside it back to the top level of the cue library.

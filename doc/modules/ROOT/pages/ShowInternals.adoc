= Show Internal Structures
include::partial$PagePreamble.adoc[]

These data structures are used internally by Beat Link Trigger to
implement shows. Because some of the elements can be useful when
writing your own expressions, they are made available to those
expressions.

[#show]
== The Show

This map contains everything Beat Link Trigger needs to know about a
show in order to be able to display and run it. Some of the elements
are not suitable for use by expressions, but some can be quite useful.
It is passed to all show expressions as the value `show`.

[#track-signatures]
.Track Signatures
NOTE: The discussion below often mentions track _signatures_. These
are strings that uniquely identify a track that can be loaded on a
player. They are calculated using things like the track's title,
artist, length, and beat grid, so the same track can be recognized
when found on different media. An example signature looks like
`"6c8139bd531a417999317a9d024d6d8ea6993507"`. While you will never
need to compute one directly yourself, you can compare them to see if
two different structures are referring to the same track, or use a
signature to look up other details about a track using the show's
`:tracks` map, described <<tracks-map,below>>.

Here's a list of some of the more useful values present in the show
map, and the keywords under which each can be found.

`:block-tracks?`:: Normally absent, but will have a `true` value if
your show expressions have called `show/block-tracks` to suppress the
normal display of tracks that makes up the user interface of the Show
window, or set up your own custom UI as described in the
<<Debugging.adoc#wireshark,Wireshark debugging section>> and the
<<Integration_XoneOnAir.adoc#,Xone:96 Channels on Air>> and
<<Integration_QLC.adoc#,QLC+ Lighting Cues>> integration examples.

`:contents`:: The basic configuration information for the show,
described <<show-contents,below>>.

`:cueing`:: A map from player numbers to track signatures if the
specified player is currently cue-playing (rather than normally
playing) the specified track.

`:default-ui`:: The Swing
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JPanel.html[`JPanel`]
holding the normal show interface displayed by Beat Link Trigger
inside the Show window (the Enabled Default, Filter, and scrolling
list of tracks). This can be replaced by calling `show/block-tracks`
as described above, but is kept here in case you later call
`(show/block-tracks nil)` to restore the normal show interface.

`:file`:: The Java
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html[`File`]
object holding the show.

`:frame`:: The Swing
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JFrame.html[`JFrame`]
holding the show window.

`:last-beat`:: A map from player number to the timestamp of the last
beat packet that was received from that player.

`:loaded`:: A map from player numbers to the track
<<track-signatures,signature>> of the track, if any, currently loaded
in that player.

`:master`:: A map from player numbers to the track signature of the
track, if any, currently loaded in that player, as long as that player
is the current Tempo Master.

[#namespace]
`:namespace`:: A unique (created by `gensym`) symbol that gets assigned to the show when it is opened, used to identify the private namespace that will be created and used to compile its shared functions and expressions, so they donâ€™t collide with any in the Triggers window, or in any other show.

`:on-air`:: A map from player numbers to track signatures showing
which tracks are currently loaded into players that are on the air
according to the mixer. (Requires a DJM mixer, and the players and
mixer must be configured to offer the on-air feature.)

[#phrases-map]
`:phrases`:: A map holding runtime (not saved) information about all
<<phrase-triggers,phrase triggers>> in the show, such as the user
interface panels which display them. The keys are
<<phrase-uuid,UUIDs>> randomly assigned to the phrase triggers when
they are created. The values that are more likely to be useful to you
are in the corresponding map within the <<phrase-contents,show
contents section>>.

`:playing`:: A map from player numbers to the track signature of the
track, if any, currently playing on that player.

`:playing-phrases`:: A map of player numbers to the currently-playing
phrase triggers that were chosen for the phrase playing on that
player, if any. This value is itself a map, whose keys are the UUIDs
of the active phrase triggers (only the ones from this show), and
whose values identify how the sections of the phrase trigger map to
beats in the track in order to make it fit.

[#tracks-map]
`:tracks`:: A map holding information about all tracks in the show. The
keys are the track's signatures, and the values are the track maps
described in the <<track,Track section>>.

[#vis-phrases]
`:vis-phrases`:: A vector of the <<phrase-uuid,UUIDs>> of all the
phrase triggers that are currently visible inthe show window, in the
order in which they appear. This can be affected by the **Filter**
text field at the top of the window (filtering on the phrase triggers'
comments), as well as the **Loaded Only** checkbox next to it (showing
only currently-active phrase triggers).

`:visible`:: A vector of the signatures of all the tracks that are
currently visible in the show window, in the order in which they
appear. This can be affected by the **Filter** text field at the top
of the window as well as the **Loaded Only** checkbox next to it.

[#show-contents]
=== Show Contents

The `:contents` map contains information that can be directly saved
into the show file to represent the configuration the user has chosen.
Some elements that might be useful include:

`:cue-library`:: Holds the definitions of any cues that have been
added to the show's library.

`:enabled`:: The value chosen in the show's menu:Enabled Default[]
menu, one of `"Never"`, `"On-Air"`, `"Master"`, `"Custom"`, or
`"Always"`.

`:expressions`:: A map holding the source text of any show-level
expressions that have been created, indexed by the keyword identifying
the expression type.

`:filter`:: The filter text that has been entered at the top of the
show window, if any, causing only matching tracks to be visible.

`:loaded-only`:: Indicates whether the **Loaded Only** checkbox at the
top of the show window has been checked, causing only tracks that are
currently loaded in a player to be visible in the window.

`:phrase-order`:: A vector of <<phrase-uuid,UUIDs>> that maintains the
order in which the phrase triggers should appear in the window,
regardless of their current visibility.

[#phrases-contents-map]
`:phrases`:: A map holding persistent (saved) information about all
phrase triggers in the show. The keys are <<phrase-uuid,UUIDs>>
randomly assigned to the phrase triggers when they are created, and
the values are the phrase trigger contents maps described in the
<<phrase-contents,Phrase Trigger Contents section>>.

`:user`:: A map for show expressions to store whatever information they need, using the `show/swap-user-data!` function.
Values are saved along with the show, so persist between runs of Beat Link Trigger, and can be accessed using `show/user-data`.
+
NOTE: The special key `:show-hue` within the `:user` map can be used to assign a custom hue to a show window (as a color wheel value in the range 0 to 360). This will be used when assigning the background color of its track rows, as well as any raw trigger rows it adds to the Triggers window, and its custom user interface if it applies one using `show/block-tracks`.

`:window`:: The left and right coordinates of the show window on the
screen, and its height and width, for use in restoring the window when
the show is opened again.


[#track]
== Tracks

Each track map contains everything Beat Link Trigger needs to know
about a track in a show in order to be able to display it and run cues
in it. Some of the elements are not suitable for use by expressions,
but some can be quite useful. It is passed to all track expressions as
the value `track`, and all tracks in the show can be found in the
`show` map under the keyword `:tracks`, further indexed by their
<<track-signatures,signatures>>.

Here's a list of some of the more useful values present in a track
map, and the keywords under which each can be found.

`:contents`:: The basic configuration information for the track,
described <<track-contents,below>>.

`:cues`:: Holds working information about the current state of the
cues in the track, for convenient and efficient display and tracking
of entry/exit. The information you are more likely to use is found
inside the `:contents` map, described <<track-contents,below>>.

`:cues-editor`:: The Swing
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JFrame.html[`JFrame`]

that shows the track waveform, cues, and current playback position of
any players that have loaded the track when it is visible in the show
window.

`:preview-canvas`:: The Swing
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JPanel.html[`JPanel`]
in which the track's graphical waveform preview, cues, and current
playback positions are drawn.

`:signature`:: The unique string that <<track-signatures,identifies>>
this track, regardless of what media it was loaded from, so it can be
recognized in the lists of which players have it loaded, playing, and
so on, or looked up in the show's <<tracks-map,`:tracks` map>>.

`:song-structure`:: If there is phrase analysis information available
for the track, this holds the

that describes it.

`:tripped`:: Will be `true` when the track is currently enabled and
loaded on at least one player (the same conditions under which there
will be a green dot showing in the <<Shows_Tracks.adoc#loaded-status,**Loaded
Status** indicator>> of the track row).


[#track-contents]
=== Track Contents

The `:contents` map contains information that can be directly saved
into the show file to represent the track configuration the user has
chosen. Some elements that might be useful include:

`:comment`:: The comment text, if any, entered to describe the track.
This can be used to filter visible tracks.

`:cues`:: Holds information about the Cues Editor associated with the

as configured with the track's
<<Shows_Tracks.adoc#track-midi-output,MIDI Output Menu>>.

`:phrase-unlocked`:: A boolean flag indicating whether phrase triggers
are allowed to run for this track. By default tracks do not allow
this, because their custom cues will likely be more meaningful.

messages are sent, as configured with the track's
<<Shows_Tracks.adoc#playing-channel-spinner,Playing Channel Spinner>>.

`:playing-message`:: The type of message that will be sent for Playing

Playing and Stopped messages, as configured with the track's
<<Shows_Tracks.adoc#playing-note-spinner,Playing Note/Controller Spinner>>.

[[track-metadata]]
=== Track Metadata

The `:metadata` map contains information obtained from the Beat Link
https://deepsymmetry.org/beatlink/apidocs/org/deepsymmetry/beatlink/data/TrackMetadata.html[`TrackMetadata`]
object describing the track. Note that few DJs fill in all this
information in rekordbox, so values are often `nil`. Available keys
and values are:

`:album`:: A string naming the album the track is part of, if any.

`:artist`:: A string naming the artist who performed the
track.

`:comment`:: A string entered by the DJ in rekordbox to make notes
about the track, if any.

`:date-added`:: A string holding a date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format
reporting when the track was imported into rekordbox.

`:duration`:: An integer holding the playback length of the track, in
seconds, at normal speed (100% pitch).

`:genre`:: A string describing the musical genre of the track.

`:key`:: A string describing the dominant musical key of the track.

performed the track, if any.

`:rating`:: An integer the number of stars (`0`--`5`) the DJ assigned
the track in rekordbox.

`:remixer`:: A string naming the person who remixed the track, if any.

`:tempo`:: An integer holding the starting tempo of the track when
played at normal speed (100% pitch). Units are beats per hundred
minutes, so a track that begins at 128.5 BPM would have the value
`12850`.

`:title`:: A string identifying the title of the track.

[[cues-editor]]
=== Track Cues Editor Information

The track's cues editor information map contains the information
needed to manage the Cues Editor window that can be opened for a
track. Its keys and values are:

`:auto-scroll`:: Will be `true` when the **Auto-Scroll** checkbox at
the top of the window is checked.

[[cues-map]]
`:cues`:: A map holding information about all cues in the track. The
keys are the cues' <<cue-uuid,UUIDs>>, and the values are the cue
maps described in the <<cue,Cue section>>.

`:entered-only`:: Will be `true` when the **Entered-Only** checkbox at
the top of the window is checked.

`:hue`:: A floating-point number representing the angle around the
color wheel that was chosen for the last cue created; used to assign
each new cue a visibly distinct hue.

`:filter`:: The filter text that has been entered at the top of the
cues editor window, if any, causing only matching cues to be
visible.

`:visible`:: A vector of the <<cue-uuid,UUIDs>> of all the cues that
are currently visible in the cues editor window, in the order in which
they appear. This can be affected by the **Filter** text field at the
top of the window, as well as the **Entered Only** checkbox next
to it.

`:window`:: The left and right coordinates of the cues editor window
on the screen, and its height and width, for use in restoring the
window when it is opened again.

`:zoom`:: An integer reporting how far out the waveform view has been
zoomed. The value `1` shows the full detail of the waveform, `2`
compresses two columns into one, and so on.

[[cue]]
== Cues

Each cue map contains everything Beat Link Trigger needs to know about
a cue in a show track or phrase trigger in order to be able to display
and run it. Some of the elements are not suitable for use by
expressions, but some can be quite useful. It is passed to all cue
expressions as the value `cue`.

Here's a list of some of the more useful values present in a cue map,
and the keywords under which each can be found.

`:comment`:: The comment text, if any, entered to describe the cue.
This shows up as a tooltip to help identify the cue on the track
waveforms, and can also be used to filter visible cues.

`:end`:: An integer that specifies the beat number within the track's
beat grid, or phrase trigger section, at which the cue ends. Must
always be at least one greater than `:start`, and can be no greater
than the largest beat number within the track or section.

`:events`:: A map containing the cue's event configuration. It has
three keys, `:entered`, `:started-on-beat`, and `started-late`, and
each of those hold inner maps with keys `:message`, `:note`, and
`:channel`. Jointly these record the choices the user has made in the
cue's <<Shows_Cues.adoc#entered-message,Entered Message Menu>>,
<<Shows_Cues.adoc#entered-note-spinner,Entered Note/Controller Spinner>>,
<<Shows_Cues.adoc#entered-channel-spinner,Entered Channel Spinner>>,
<<Shows_Cues.adoc#started-on-beat-menu,Started On-Beat Message Menu>>,
<<Shows_Cues.adoc#started-on-beat-note-spinner,Started On-Beat Note/Controller
Spinner>>, <<Shows_Cues.adoc#started-on-beat-channel-spinner,Started On-Beat
Channel Spinner>>, <<Shows_Cues.adoc#started-late-menu,Started Late Message
Menu>>, <<Shows_Cues.adoc#started-late-note-spinner,Started Late Note/Controller
Spinner>>, and <<Shows_Cues.adoc#started-late-channel-spinner,Started Late
Channel Spinner>> respectively.
+
To make this concrete, here is an example `:events` map:
+
[source,clojure]
----
{:entered         {:message "Note", :note 1, :channel 1}
 :started-on-beat {:message "Note", :note 2, :channel 1}
 :started-late    {:message "None", :note 3, :channel 1}}
----

`:expressions`:: A map holding the source text of any cue-level
expressions that have been created, indexed by the keyword identifying
the expression type.

`:hue`:: An floating point value that specifies the angle (in degrees)
around the color wheel that is used when drawing this cue.

`:section`:: Present only for cues which are in a phrase trigger,
identifies the section of the phrase trigger in which the cue exists
(will be one of `:start`, `:loop`, `:end`, or `:fill`).

`:start`:: An integer that specifies the beat number within the track
beat grid, or phrase trigger section, at which the cue begins. Must be
positive (non-zero: in the DJ Link protocol, beat numbers start with
1) and less than `:end`.

[[cue-uuid]]
`:uuid`:: The unique identifier (a Java
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/UUID.html[UUID]
object) that identifies this cue within the show, so it can be
recognized in the lists of which players are positioned inside it,
playing it, and so on, or looked up in a <<cues-map,track's>> or
<<phrase-cues-map,phrase trigger's>> `:cues`
map.


[[phrase-triggers]]
== Phrase Triggers

In addition to tracks, starting with version 7, shows can also contain
phrase triggers, which can run cues whenever a track plays a
particular kind of phrase (as analyzed by rekordbox).

The phrase information is split into two parts, both of which are
indexed by the phrase <<phrase-uuid,UUID>>. This part, found under the
key `:phrases` in the show map is computed at runtime for rapid and
efficient display and processing but is not stored in the show file.
The <<phrase-contents,saved part>> is found in the show `:contents`
map, also under the key `:phrases` there.

`:cues`:: Holds working information about the current state of the
cues in the phrase trigger, for convenient and efficient display and
tracking of entry/exit. The information you are more likely to use is
found inside the `:contents` map, described <<phrase-contents,below>>.

`:cues-editor`:: The Swing
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JFrame.html[`JFrame`]
holding the cues editor window for the phrase trigger, if one has been
opened.

`:entered`:: A map from player numbers to the set of <<cue-uuid,cue
UUIDs>> of the cues, if any, that player is currently positioned
inside of.

`:file`:: The Java
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html[`File`]
object holding the show to which the phrase trigger belongs.

`:panel`:: The Swing
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JPanel.html[`JPanel`]
holding user interface of the phrase trigger row.

[[phrase-uuid]]
`:uuid`:: The unique identifier (a Java
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/UUID.html[UUID]
object) that identifies this phrase trigger within the show, so it can
be recognized in the <<vis-phrases,list of which are currently
visible>>, and referenced in other ways.

`:tripped`:: Will be `true` when the phrase trigger is currently
enabled and was chosen in response to a phrase playing on at least one
player (the same conditions under which there will be a green dot
showing in the <<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#playing-status,**Playing Status**
indicator>> of the phrase trigger row).


[[phrase-contents]]
=== Phrase Trigger Contents

Each phrase trigger contents map contains everything Beat Link Trigger
needs to know about a phrase trigger in a show in order to be able to
display it and run cues in it. Some of the elements are not suitable
for use by expressions, but some can be quite useful. It is passed to
all phrase trigger expressions as the value `trigger`. Note that
phrase triggers also have a <<phrase-triggers,runtime information
map>>, which is found directly in the show map, and not saved as part
of the show file.

The phrase trigger contents map, found within the show `:contents`
map, contains information that can be directly saved into the show
file to represent the phrase trigger configuration the user has
chosen. Some elements that might be useful include:

`:channel`:: The MIDI channel on which Playing and Stopped messages
are sent, as configured with the phrase trigger's
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#channel-spinner,Channel Spinner>>.

`:comment`:: The comment text, if any, entered to describe the phrase
trigger. This can be used to filter visible phrase triggers.

`:cues`:: Holds information about the Cues Editor associated with the
phrase trigger, as described <<phrase-cues-editor,below>>.

`:enabled`:: Controls how the phrase trigger is matched against
playing track phrases. Has one of two values: `"See Below"` means that
all of the <<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#enabling-weighting,Enabling and
Weighting>> user elements (and their associated values in this
section) are used, and `"Custom"` means that your own
<<Expressions_PhraseTrigger.adoc#enabled-filter-expression,Enabled
Filter expression>> will be called instead, and its results will
control what happens.

`:enabled-phrase-types`:: The set of phrase types which will allow
this phrase trigger to activate when they play. Controlled by the
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#phrase-picker,*Phrase Types* Picker>>, the
set will contain any combination of the following elements:

<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#structure,End section>> of the phrase
trigger is. This can be zero, meaning that the Loop section is
immediately followed by the Fill section.

`:expressions`:: A map holding the source text of any phrase trigger
level expressions that have been created, indexed by the keyword
identifying the expression type.

`:fill-bars`:: The number of bars long the
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#structure,Fill section>> at the end of the
phrase trigger is. This section will be repeated as many times as
needed to align the size of the phrase trigger with the size of the
fill-in section of the playing phrase that it matched.

`:loop-bars`:: The number of bars long the
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#structure,Loop section>> of the phrase
trigger is. This section will be repeated as many times as needed to
align the size of the phrase trigger with the size of the playing
phrase that it matched.

`:max-bars?`:: A `boolean` value that records whether the checkbox in
front of the phrase trigger's
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#enabling-weighting,*Max Bars:* Checkbox>>
is checked, and therefore whether the value in `:max-bars` should be
honored.

`:max-bars`:: The maximum number of bars long a playing phrase can be
in order to activate this phrase trigger, configured using the
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#enabling-weighting,*Max bars* Spinner>>. Only
used when `:max-bars?` is `true`.

`:max-bpm?`:: A `boolean` value that records whether the checkbox in
front of the phrase trigger's
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#enabling-weighting,*Max BPM:* Checkbox>>
is checked, and therefore whether the value in `:max-bpm` should be
honored.

`:max-bpm`:: The maximum tempo, in beats per minute, for which this
phrase trigger will activate, configured using the
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#enabling-weighting,*Max BPM* Spinner>>.

`:message`:: The type of message that will be sent for Playing and
Stopped events, as configured with the phrase trigger's
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#message,Message Menu>>.

`:midi-device`:: The MIDI device to which phrase trigger messages will
be sent, as configured with the phrase trigger's
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#midi-output,MIDI Output Menu>>.

`:min-bars?`:: A `boolean` value that records whether the checkbox in
front of the phrase trigger's
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#enabling-weighting,*Min Bars:* Checkbox>>
is checked, and therefore whether the value in `:min-bars` should be
honored.

`:min-bars`:: The minimum number of bars long a playing phrase can be
in order to activate this phrase trigger, configured using the
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#enabling-weighting,*Min Bars* Spinner>>.
Only used when `:min-bars?` is `true`.

`:min-bpm?`:: A `boolean` value that records whether the checkbox in
front of the phrase trigger's
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#enabling-weighting,*Min BPM:* Checkbox>>
is checked, and therefore whether the value in `:min-bpm` should be
honored.

`:min-bpm`:: The minimum tempo, in beats per minute, for which this
phrase trigger will activate, configured using the
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#enabling-weighting,*Min BPM* Spinner>>.
Only used when `:min-bpm?` is `true`.

`:note`:: The MIDI note (or controller number) used to send Playing
and Stopped messages, as configured with the phrase trigger's
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#note-spinner,Note/Controller Spinner>>.

`:players`:: Controls which players will be considered when looking
for phrases that match this phrase trigger, as confugred with the
phrase trigger's <<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#players-menu,Players
Menu>>. Choices are `"Master"`, `"On-Air"`, or `"Any"`.

`:start-bars`:: The number of bars long the
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#structure,Start section>> of the phrase
trigger is. This can be zero, meaning that the first section is the
Loop section.

`:solo`:: Controls the
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#exclusivity,Exclusivity>> of the phrase
trigger. The default value is `"Show"`, which means that only one such
trigger will be chosen for the entire show (but other `"Show"` Solo
triggers might be running for the same phrase in other shows). Other
choices include `"Global"`, which (as its name suggests) will only
allow one such trigger to be chosen from any open show (although
triggers in other exculsivity modes will still be allowed to run), and
`"Blend"`, which means this trigger will activate whenever its
criteria are met, regardless of how many other triggers are activating
in any show for the current phrase.

`:uuid`:: The unique identifier (a Java
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/UUID.html[UUID]
object) that identifies this phrase trigger within the show, so it can
be recognized in the <<vis-phrases,list of which are currently
visible>>, and referenced in other ways.

`:weight`:: Adjusts how likely this phrase trigger will be chosen if
if it is configured as Solo and other Solo matches exist for a
phrase that has started to play. This is configured using the
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#enabling-weighting,*Weight* Spinner>>.


[[phrase-cues-editor]]
=== Phrase Trigger Cues Editor Information

The phrase trigger's cues editor information map contains the
information needed to manage the Cues Editor window that can be opened
for a phrase trigger. Its keys and values are:

`:auto-scroll`:: Will be `true` when the **Auto-Scroll** checkbox at
the top of the window is checked.

[[phrase-cues-map]]
`:cues`:: A map holding information about all cues in the phrase
trigger. The keys are the cues' <<cue-uuid,UUIDs>>, and the
values are the cue maps described in the <<cue,Cue section>>.

`:entered-only`:: Will be `true` when the **Entered-Only** checkbox at
the top of the window is checked.

`:hue`:: A floating-point number representing the angle around the
color wheel that was chosen for the last cue created; used to assign
each new cue a visibly distinct hue.

`:filter`:: The filter text that has been entered at the top of the
cues editor window, if any, causing only matching cues to be
visible.

`:visible`:: A vector of the <<cue-uuid,UUIDs>> of all the cues
that are currently visible in the cues editor window, in the order in
which they appear. This can be affected by the **Filter** text field
at the top of the window, as well as the **Entered Only** checkbox
next to it.

`:window`:: The left and right coordinates of the cues editor window
on the screen, and its height and width, for use in restoring the
window when it is opened again.

`:zoom`:: An integer reporting how far out the cue canvas view has
been zoomed. The value `1` shows the most detail available, `2`
compresses two columns into one, and so on.

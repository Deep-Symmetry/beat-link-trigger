= Beat Link Trigger User Guide
James Elliott <james@deepsymmetry.org>

This is an introduction to the Beat Link Trigger interface and
expression programming environment. It shows some ways you can use it,
but as an open-ended environment, the possibilities are endless. If
you have questions or other approaches you’d like to share, please
post to the
https://deep-symmetry.zulipchat.com/join/lp5i6yolkay7erzjzodx365q/[Zulip
stream].

To keep page sizes manageable, this guide is split into several pages.
It is worth reading through this whole guide once if you are new to
Beat Link Trigger. Once you know what you are looking for, you can
also dive right into it by jumping to the page you want using the
navigation menu on the left.

.Versions
****
ifdef::page-origin-worktree[]
You are looking at the local (embedded) version of the User Guide. Its
content will reflect exactly the version of the software that you are
running, because it was built into it, and can be accessed even when
you are disconnected from the Internet. Any links to external
resources, however, will only work if you are online.
endif::[]
ifndef::page-origin-worktree[]
ifeval::["{page-component-version}" == "master"]
You are looking at the **main** branch of the User Guide. This tries
to keep up with the latest in-progress changes to the software, which
are frequently made available as preview builds.

To look at a version of the Guide that corresponds to a specfic
release, choose it in the versions menu either at the top right (just
before the **Edit this Page** link), or at the bottom left.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{page-component-version}" != "master"]
You are looking at version *{page-component-version}* of the User
Guide, which corresponds to that release of the software.

To look at a different version (including the main branch, which
reflects ongoing development that is available as a preview release
but not yet officially released), choose it in the versions menu
either at the top right (just before the **Edit this Page** link), or
at the bottom left.

[[startup]]
== Startup

When you first open Beat Link Trigger, it tries to find the Pro DJ
Link devices that you want it to monitor. While it is watching the
network for them, it displays a window like this:

image:FindingDevices.png[Looking for devices,512,512]

If you just wanted to work on setting up your triggers, expressions,
or shows, and don’t have any actual players handy, you can click
kbd:[Continue Offline] to work in an offline mode. Your triggers won’t
actually fire, but you can do all the configuration and editing that
you need, and you can load tracks into your shows using rekordbox USB
and SD media.

If no DJ Link devices can be found after about twenty seconds of
searching, it probably means something is misconfigured on your
network, so Beat Link Trigger will replace the window with a
troubleshooting version that looks like this:

image:NoDevices.png[No devices found,505,468]

If you were expecting to find devices, double-check that they are
powered on, and properly networked with your computer (and that any
hub or wireless router you are using is also properly turned on and
configured). The window shows all network interfaces that were found
in your computer, along with the IP address and net mask assigned to
your computer on that interface. The devices will only be able to
communicate with you if they have compatible IPv4 addresses. If you
are not on a network with a DHCP server, for example, the players will
assign themselves addresses of the form 169.254._x_._y_/16, so if none
of your addresses match that pattern, you will not be able to
communicate with them.

While you work on making sure your network interfaces and cables are
configured properly. Beat Link Trigger is continuing to watch for
devices, so as soon as you get the issue sorted out, it will go
online. And as noted above, if that isn't going to happen, you can
click kbd:[Continue Offline] to work in an offline mode, or you can
click kbd:[Quit] to give up and try again later, perhaps in a
different setting.

Once a device is found, or you choose to continue offline, the
Triggers window opens, in the same configuration that you left it the
last time you used the program, and any Show files you had open will
be reopened as well.

=== Connecting Later

If you connect to a DJ Link network after a period of working on your
shows and triggers in offline mode, you can take Beat Link Trigger
online by checking menu:Network[Online?]

image:GoingOnline.png[Going Online,360,200]

You can also go offline at any time by un-checking the menu option.

[TIP]
====
If there has been a disruption to the network, and you seem to have
lost contact with the players, taking Beat Link Trigger offline and
then going back online can often solve the problem. It will generally
try to do this for you automatically when it loses contact with the
last DJ Link device.
====

[[checking-player-number]]
=== Checking your Player Number

Once you have successfully taken Beat Link Trigger online, you can
see what Player Number it is using by looking at the menu:Network[Online?]
menu option without toggling it again. Whenever it is checked, the
Player Number being used by Beat Link is shown there.

image:CarabinerConnectionMenu.png[Ableton Link: Carabiner Connection menu,360,200]

Most of the time you will want to be using the self-assigned device
number Player 7, as shown here, because that is compatible with big
shows where there are four real players in use (or even six, if they
are all CDJ-3000s). However, if you want to do things like letting an
Ableton Link session become the Tempo Master and
<<Link#full-sync,control the speed>> and beat sync of the players, or
display metadata for CD and other non-rekordbox tracks, you will need
to use a real player number in the range 1–4, which may require you
to turn off one of the other players.

[[fixing-network-problems]]
== Fixing Network Problems

If Beat Link Trigger reports that it can’t find any DJ Link devices
when you try to take it online, this means there is a problem with
your network. People often ask for a connection diagram, but there is
really nothing to diagram: as long as you have your players and the
computer running BLT on the same LAN, it will work.

That could mean anything from plugging a single player directly into
the LAN adapter of your computer (with a modern Ethernet adapter with
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-dependent_interface#Auto_MDI-X[Auto-MDI-X]),
to plugging everything into a fast hub, switch (which most things
called “hubs” really are today), or router.

By far the most common problems involve configuration issues with the
network adapter on the computer running Beat Link Trigger. So here is
a list of things to think about and watch out for.

> If you are still stuck after following this advice, you can ask for
> help on the
> https://deep-symmetry.zulipchat.com/join/lp5i6yolkay7erzjzodx365q/[Zulip
> stream].

=== Use a Separate Network for your DJ gear

The best scenario is to have a completely separate switch for only
your DJ gear, and a secondary network adapter on the computer running
BLT. Connect all the DJ gear and that network adapter to that one
switch. Make sure that switch isn’t connected to other
switches/routers, this can make the Pro-DJ Link traffic go bananas.

If you still want to be able to access the Internet from the computer
running Beat Link Trigger, you can do so by connecting its primary
network adapter to another switch or router that is connected to the
Internet. This way you can use the primary network adapter on your BLT
computer to do anything that requires global connectivity, and the
secondary adapter for BLT and the DJ Link network.

If your computer has only one network adapter, then it is best not to
attempt Internet connectivity, and connect only to the DJ gear network
while running shows.

=== IP Address Assignment


The next major thing that needs to be correct for the players and Beat
Link Trigger to be able to talk to each other is for them to have a
shared understanding of what network they are on, and IP addresses and
net masks that are mutually compatible.

> Of course, you should check that the adapter is active at all, it
> might have been disabled at the OS level, or there may be a problem
> with the hardware or the cable.

=== Self-Assigned Addresses (APIPA, auto-IP)

In the simplest case there is no DHCP server on the DJ gear network,
so the players will self-assign a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address[Link-Local Address]
(further details in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3927[RFC-3927]).
This is an address of the form 169.254._x_._y_, and if you have left
the network adapter settings at their default DHCP mode in macOS or
Windows (and probably Linux), it will self-assign a compatible address
in the same range. Windows calls this
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address#IPv4[APIPA]. You can
verify this has happened by looking at the list of networks that Beat
Link Trigger displays when it is reporting it can’t find DJ Link
devices. If the network adapter is not using an address that is in
this range, then you’ll need to fix its configuration.

* If the adapter is configured to a hard-coded address, either change
  that address and net mask to match the Link-local network, or change
  it to use DHCP so that it will fall back to using link-local
  addressing when it finds no DHCP server.

* If it is already configured to use DHCP, tell it to try to renew its
  lease. (In Windows, `ipconfig /release` followed by `ipconfig
  /renew`. In macOS, here are
  https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/renew-ip-address-dhcp-server-mac-mchlp1545/10.15/mac/10.15[Apple’s
  instructions] and a nice
  https://osxdaily.com/2015/07/30/release-renew-dhcp-command-line-ipconfig/[osXdaily
  article]. In Linux, you’ll generally want to
  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/405229/how-to-release-and-renew-ip-address-from-dhcp-on-linux-systems[use
  `dhclient`].)

=== DHCP Managed Networks

If you want to have more control over the IP address assignments and
network parameters of your DJ network, and are running your own DHCP
server, you will already know most of this information and
troubleshooting steps. But:

* Make sure the DHCP server has plenty of time to boot, and was ready
  to respond before you power on the CDJs or attach the computer’s
  network adapter. Otherwise they may time out waiting for the server
  and self-assign IP addresses as described above.

* Turning the CDJ off for a few seconds and then back on once you know
  the DHCP server is ready will give the player a chance to get the
  address you intended for it.

* If the network adapter doesn’t show the correct address in Beat Link
  Trigger’s troubleshooting window, follow the instructions in the
  previous section for releasing and renewing your DHCP lease.

=== Firewall and Anti-Virus Software

You need to be sure that there is no firewall or anti-virus software
on the host computer blocking Beat Link Trigger from communicating on
the network adapter. Either of those things can prevent it from
joining the DJ Link network.

=== Other DJ Link Software (like rekordbox)

Because of fundamental limitations in the design of the DJ Link
protocol, only one program can connect to the DJ Link network on a
given network adapter. So it is impossible to run Beat Link Trigger on
the same computer as rekordbox, or any other software that wants to
communicate with the DJ Link network.

=== Other Port Conflicts

If you are running any software that happens to randomly use the same
ports as the DJ Link protocol (one culprit in Windows turns out to be
the https://anydesk.com/[AnyDesk remote desktop software]) this will
also prevent Beat Link Trigger (or rekordbox) from starting up
properly. You will want to look for conflicts on ports 50000, 50001,
and 50002 (and remember you need to check the UDP protocol, not just
TCP).

* On macOS and Linux you can use, for example, `lsof -i :50000` to see
  the process using port 50000. (You may need to install `lsof` using
  your preferred package manager on Linux; it is preinstalled on
  macOS. Other Linux alternatives are described
  https://www.tecmint.com/find-out-which-process-listening-on-a-particular-port/[here].)

* On Windows you can use the Resource Monitor GUI:
  menu:Start menu[All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Resource Monitor]
  (or run `resmon.exe`). Remember to look for both UDP and TCP listeners and
  connections.

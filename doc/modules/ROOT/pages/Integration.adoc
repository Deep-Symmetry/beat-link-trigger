= Integration Examples
include::partial$PagePreamble.adoc[]

When explaining the Beat Link Trigger interface and how to extend it
with custom expressions, we showed some examples of ways to integrate
other systems. This section builds on the concepts introduced there,
to demonstrate useful and practical integrations with systems we (or
our early adopters) use regularly.

You may be able to use some of these integrations as-is to help with
your shows, or they may provide examples of how you can build your own
integration with something new. If you do try that, please share your
progress! We can help, and then we can share your results with other
users.

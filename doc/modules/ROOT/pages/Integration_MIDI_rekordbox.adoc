= MIDI Cues from rekordbox
include::partial$PagePreamble.adoc[]

http://www.netskymusic.com[Netsky] was setting up a
<<Shows.adoc#,show>> to run lights during his live streams and came up
with a terrific idea: might it be possible to have Beat Link Trigger
send simple MIDI cues to his lighting controller based on hot cues
created right within rekordbox, without the need to import the track
into a show file and draw the cues there?

Indeed, now that we know how to read cue names from the track analysis
files, this can be done, and offers a very nice shortcut! Here's how
it works. You can start by downloading the
link:{attachmentsdir}/cueMidiSender.blt[configuration file] I created
for him and opening that within Beat Link Trigger. That will set up a
single trigger called "Cue-driven MIDI Sender" that watches the
current Master player.

WARNING: If you already have triggers of your own that you want to
keep, be sure to save your configuration before opening another one!
In that case you may want to export your triggers, or manually copy
and paste the relevant pieces of code, <<shared-functions,shown
below>>, into your Shared Functions and Expressions.

== Overview

Once you have the functions, expressions, and trigger set up, using it
is pretty simple! Within rekordbox, create a memory point or hot cue
at the beat where you want a MIDI message to be sent, and then put the
string `MIDI:` followed by the note number that you want to be sent
when that beat is reached. For example, a hot cue with `MIDI:5`
somewhere in its name would send note 5 when that beat is reached. The
memory point or hot cue needs to be on a beat for this to work.

If you already have a hot cue or memory point at the beat where
you want the MIDI message sent, you can use it instead of creating
another one there: just add the MIDI note request to its name.

If you want more than one MIDI note to be sent when that beat is
reached, you can list multiple numbers separated by commas (but no
spaces or other characters), like `MIDI:5,42,100` which would send
notes 5, 42, and 100 when reached.

If you enter a number that is not a valid MIDI note (less than 1 or
greater than 127), it will be ignored, and a warning about it will be
added to the log file when that track is loaded.

TIP: If you don't want to only respond to cues being played on the
Master player, you can change the player being watched by the trigger
using the <<Triggers.adoc#watch-menu,Watch menu>>, and you can use the
trigger's <<Triggers.adoc#context-menu,gear or context menu>> to
export it to a file, then <<Triggers.adoc#,create new triggers>> and
import that file into them, so you can have multiple copies watching
different players.

== Shared Code

How does this all work? And if you don't want to blow away your
configuration by loading the one linked above, how do you add these
features to your existing configuration?

This first set of expressions are configured using the menu:Triggers[]
menu at the top of the window.

[[shared-functions]]
=== Shared Functions

The first bit of magic happens by registering some code to watch for
tracks to be loaded, and look for the special MIDI note markers in
their cue lists. This is supported by a set of shared functions.

If you loaded the configuration file, you don't need to type these,
but may want to read them to learn more about how to create
integrations like this. If you are keeping your existing configuration
and want to add these new features, then copy and paste these at the
end of your Triggers window Shared Functions:

```clojure
(defonce  ;; <1>
 ^{:doc "Holds a map from player number to a map of cue times for that player.
  The cue time maps are indexed by track position (in milliseconds),
  and their values are sets of MIDI note numbers to send when we reach
  a beat that is within 50 milliseconds of that time. This map is
  built by `find-midi-cues` below whenever the track metadata for a
  player changes."}
  midi-cue-times (atom {}))

(defn valid-midi-notes <2>
  "Given a string containing a comma-delimited series of numbers,
  returns a set consisting of all the numbers which correspond to
  valid MIDI note numbers. Logs warnings for any which do not,
  including the full name of the cue to help identify it."
  [note-string cue-name]
  (reduce (fn [result note]
            (if (<= 1 note 127)  ; Check that the number is a valid MIDI note.
              (conj result note)
              (do  ; No, log warning and ignore this number.
                (timbre/warn "Ignoring invalid MIDI note number" note
                             "from cue" cue-name)
                result)))
          #{}
          (map #(Long/valueOf %) (clojure.string/split note-string #","))))

(defn find-midi-cues <3>
  "Scans all the cues and loops found in the supplied track metadata
  looking for any that contain the string MIDI: followed immediately
  by a number. Returns a map whose keys are the track time at which
  each such cue or loop begins, and whose values are sets of the
  number that was found in the cue name(s) that started at that time.
  If there is no track metadata, or it has no cue list, returns
  `nil`."
  [^TrackMetadata md]
  (when md
    (when-let [cue-list (.getCueList md)]
      (reduce (fn [result cue]
                (if-let [[_ notes] (re-find #"MIDI:(\d+(,\d+)*)"
                                            (.-comment cue))]  ; Name matches.
                  (update result (.-cueTime cue) (fnil clojure.set/union #{})
                          (valid-midi-notes notes (.-comment cue)))
                  result))
              {} (.-entries cue-list)))))

(def midi-cue-indexer <4>
  "Responds to the coming and going of track metadata, and updates our
  list of cue-defined beats on which MIDI messages need to be sent."
  (reify org.deepsymmetry.beatlink.data.TrackMetadataListener
    (metadataChanged [this md-update]
      (swap! midi-cue-times assoc (.player md-update)
                                  (find-midi-cues (.metadata md-update))))))

(defn send-midi-cues-near-time <5>
  "Finds all MIDI cues close enough to the specified time for the
  specified device and sends the corresponding MIDI notes on the
  specified MIDI output and channel."
  [time device-number midi-output midi-channel]
  (doseq [[_ notes] (filter (fn [[cue-time]]
                             (> 50 (Math/abs (- time cue-time))))
                            (get @midi-cue-times device-number))]
        ;; Send note-on messages for each note specified by a cues we reached.
        (doseq [note notes]
          (midi/midi-note-on midi-output note 127 (dec midi-channel)))
        ;; And then immediately send the corresponding note-off messages too.
        (doseq [note notes]
          (midi/midi-note-off midi-output note (dec midi-channel)))))
```

<1> This sets up an atom that will hold an index by player of any cues
in that player's track whose name match the `MIDI:` pattern, their
position within the track, and the MIDI notes that should be sent when
the beat at that position is reached.

<2> This splits the note-number part of the pattern we matched into a
set of actual note numbers, rejecting and warning about any numbers
that aren't valid MIDI notes.

<3> This takes the metadata that describes a track that has been
loaded into a player, and scans through all the hot cues, memory
points, and loops in that track, looking for the pattern that
identifies a request for MIDI notes. It builds the index structure for
that track.

<4> This creates an object that can be registered with the Beat Link
library to update the MIDI cue index whenever there is new information
about a track loaded in a player by calling the functions above.

<5> This is a helper function called by the trigger whenever the track
has moved to a new beat. It uses the index to see if it's supposed to
send any MIDI notes, and sends them.

=== Global Setup Expression

When the configuration file is loaded, this arranges for the indexing
function to be run as tracks come and go:

```clojure
(.addTrackMetadataListener metadata-finder midi-cue-indexer)
```

=== Global Shutdown Expression

When the Triggers window is being closed, or a different configuration
file is being loaded, this line unregisters our indexer:

```clojure
(.removeTrackMetadataListener metadata-finder midi-cue-indexer)
```

== Trigger Code

The rest of the code goes in the trigger itself. If you didn't load
the configuration file, create a new trigger, type "Cue-driven MIDI
Sender" for its comment, set it to Watch the Master Player, set its
Enabled filter to Always, and its Message to Custom, as shown
<<trigger-window,above>>.

TIP: You can close the Activation Expression editor that gets opened
up without typing anything in there, because this is an unusual
trigger that sends messages at times other than when it activates or
deactivates. But we still want to have Message set to Custom because
we don't want stray MIDI messages being sent just because the track
started or stopped.

Set the MIDI Output and Channel to where you want the MIDI messages to
go. And then it's time for the final expressions that tie this all
together. These are edited using the trigger's
<<Triggers.adoc#context-menu,gear or context menu>>:

=== Beat Expression

This is run whenever a beat packet is received from the watched
player, so it is a great place to check if it is time to send any MIDI
cues using the helper function we looked at above:

```clojure
;; We can only run when a valid MIDI output is chosen,
;; and the TimeFinder is running.
(when (and trigger-output track-time-reached)
  ;; Record that this beat has been handled, and
  ;; the Tracked Update expression can ignore it.
  (swap! midi-cue-times assoc-in [:sent device-number] beat-number)
  ;; Send the MIDI cues, if any, falling on this beat.
  (send-midi-cues-near-time track-time-reached device-number
                            trigger-output trigger-channel))
```

If you read the comments in that code, they foreshadowed an issue: One
thing that makes running shows based on the Pro DJ Link protocol
challenging is that you don't always get beat messages when you want
them. If you are playing through a track and pass over a beat, you're
golden, you get the packet. But if you start the track at a beat, or
jump to a hot cue that is at a beat, then sometimes you don't receive
the beat packet, because the track was already a tiny bit past the
precise beat moment.

So that is what led to the most tricky code here (and in the Show
feature). Here's how we work around it.

=== Tracked Update Expression

This is run whenever we get a status update from a player, which
happens around five times per second. We can use it to see if we have
started playing without getting a beat packet, or if we have jumped to
a new beat because of a hot cue or memory point.

```clojure
;; We can only run when playing, a valid MIDI output is chosen,
;; and the TimeFinder is running.
(when (and playing? trigger-output track-time-reached)
  ;; Do nothing if the current beat has already been handled.
  (when (not= beat-number (get-in @midi-cue-times [:sent device-number]))
    ;; Note that this beat's been handled for next time.
    (swap! midi-cue-times assoc-in [:sent device-number] beat-number)
    ;; Send the MIDI cues, if any, for the point where playback began.
    ;; We assume playback began at the start of the current beat.
    (let [grid    (.getLatestBeatGridFor beatgrid-finder device-number)
          started (.getTimeWithinTrack grid beat-number)]
      (send-midi-cues-near-time started device-number
                                trigger-output trigger-channel))))
```

Both the Beat Expression and this Tracked Update expression make a
special entry in the index atom to report when they have handled a
particular beat, so this code doesn't send that beat's MIDI notes more
than once.

If the current beat hasn't been marked as already handled, this code
finds the start time of the current beat, looks up any notes that
should be sent for it, and sends them in the same way the Beat
Expression did.

With those two expressions in place, it doesn't matter how a beat is
reached, its notes (if any) get sent.

=== Deactivation Expression

One final nice touch: if the DJ stops the track, we want to clear out
the notion of what beat was handled, so that when the track starts up
again, cues can get sent for it:

```clojure
;; Clear record of last beat handled since the player is stopping.
;; If we restart in this same location, we should evaluate cues again.
(swap! midi-cue-times update :sent dissoc device-number)
```

And that's all the code! Although there is a fair bit, considering how
handy a new feature it implements, I was happy to see how compact and
clean it could be.

directions to take it, please raise them on the

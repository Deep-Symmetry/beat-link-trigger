= Editing Track Cues
include::partial$PagePreamble.adoc[]
:page-toclevels: 3

Tracks have settings and expressions that allow you to make things
happen when they load or start and stop playing, but you will often be
interested in more specific _parts_ of the track being played. That’s
where Cues come in. To add Cues to a Track, choose
menu:Edit Track Cues[] in the Track’s context menu, as described in the
previous section. That will open a new window for viewing and editing
details about that Track’s Cues:

[#cues-window]
image:CuesWindow.png[Cues Window,912,461]

Before introducing the various ways to add Cues to the track, let’s
explore the features available at the top of the window.

NOTE: This kind of window is also used for editing cues within
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#,phrase triggers>>, although it has a
slightly different appearance and set of features
<<Shows_PhraseTriggers.adoc#editing-cues,in that context>>.

== Cues Window Header Elements

At the top of the Cues window, above any Cues that you have added to
it, is a header that shows a scrollable and zoomable view of the track
waveform and beat grid, much like the one that appears in the
<<Players.adoc#,Player Status Window>>, except that you can manually
scroll this one to the section you want to see regardless of whether
any players are currently playing it. If any are, you will see their
playback position(s) marked on the waveform as illustrated above, but
they will not cause the waveform to scroll to follow them unless you
check the `Auto-Scroll` checkbox. Although you won’t want to do that
when you are editing cues, it can be nice when running a show, as it
makes it easy to follow along as Cues approach and run.

The kbd:[New Cue] button creates a new cue on the first beat of the
Track, unless you have selected a beat range first as described below.

As with the Show window, if you type any text in the `Filter` box,
only Cues that match that text will be visible. Similarly, if you
check the `Entered Only` checkbox, only Cues that currently have a
player positioned inside them will be visible. This is a great way to
narrow down your focus to watch what is going on with cues the DJ is
currently playing.

TIP: The `Entered Only` and `Auto-Scroll` checkboxes are only visible
when Beat Link Trigger is Online, because they only make sense in the
context of being able to detect that a player has loaded the track.

[[adding-cues]]
== Adding Cues to a Track

The Cues window doesn’t do much until you add at least one Cue. As
mentioned above, you can use the kbd:[New Cue] button to do this, and
then edit the cue to position it where you want it, but it is easier
to specify where you want it on the beat grid first. To do that,
you can click and drag in the waveform view to highlight the beats
that you want the Cue to run for. Dragging over the eight beats
past where the player was cued in the above example sets up a
selection like this:

image:DraggingCue.png[Cues Window,793,166]

If your aim was slightly off, you can drag the edges of the selection
to adjust them, as suggested by the cursor in the image above, or you
can shift-click to grow or shrink the cue, perhaps after scrolling
the wavform to a different section. Also remember that you can adjust
the Zoom slider to make it easier to position your cue.

Alternately, you can click to select a single beat, then shift-click
another to specify the entire range without dragging. If you created a
beat selection by accident and want to get rid of it, you can either
drag it back down to nothing, or click a single beat outside the
selection and then shift-click it to deselect it.

Regardless of how you do it, once you have the right beats selected,
clicking the kbd:[New Cue] button will create a new cue covering
the chosen beats:

image:FirstCue.png[First cue added,912,461]

[[cue-row-elements]]
== Cue Row Elements

[[start-end-spinners]]
=== Start and End Spinners

You can see and adjust the beats on which the Cue starts and ends
using these two fields, either by typing new values, or clicking the
arrows. However, it is probably even more convenient to simply drag
the edges of the cue in the waveform, which also works.

The End must always be at least one beat past the Start, and neither
can extend outside the beat grid of the Track.

[[cue-name]]
=== Cue Name

To help understand the purpose of the cue, you can give it a name. The
default is `Untitled` (with a numeric suffix if needed to keep it
distinct), but as soon as the cue is created, the Name field is
selected and ready for you to type something more meaningful. For this
example, we’ll type "First two measures", since we placed the cue at
the point where this track begins playback after being loaded.

The cue name also appears as a tool tip when you hover the mouse
pointer over the cue in the waveform:

image:CueNamed.png[Cue named,790,278]

[[cue-hue]]
=== Cue Hue

Cues are assigned distinct hues when they are created to help you tell
them apart (and to tie the cue in the waveform to the corresponding
detail row below), but you can also assign each cue a specific hue if
that helps organize your show by clicking the `Hue` swatch in the Cue
row. That will bring up a color picker window wher you can choose the
exact hue you want.

If cues overlap each other, Beat Link Trigger draws them in separate
lanes to make it easier to tell where each begins and ends. It can
handle even very complex sets of overlapping cues, adjusting them
into a minimal set of lanes. Here’s an example of what it would look
like if we added a second cue called “Video Clip 1” that overlaps
part of our first cue:

image:SecondCue.png[Overlapping cues,791,389]

Cues are also visible, and show their names as tool tips, in the
waveform preview drawn in Track rows in the Show window, so you don’t
even need to open the Cues Editor for a quick reminder of what cues
are coming up:

image:CuesInShowWindow.png[Overlapping cues,886,218]

In both waveforms, <<entered-status,Entered>> Cues are whitened
slightly and <<started-status,Started>> Cues are whitened even
more as a visual indicator of their state.

[[cue-context-menu-button]]
=== Context Menu Button

Below the first row of cue configuration elements there is a gear
button that allows you to access the cue’s Context Menu with a regular
mouse click. The gear will be filled in if any Expressions have been
added to the Cue, and hollow otherwise. The contents of the menu
itself are described <<cue-context-menu,below>>.

[[entered-status]]
=== Entered Status

To the right of the context menu button there is an Entered Status
indicator which has two parts. The outer ring indicates whether the
Cue’s Track is currently enabled (a green circle) or disabled (a red
circle with a slash). If any player is currently positioned anywhere
inside the Cue, there is a filled circle inside the enabled indicator
ring:

[width="50%",cols=".^,^.^",options="header"]
|===
|State
|Indicator

|Disabled, Not Entered
|image:Disabled.png[Disabled,52,52]

|Enabled, Not Entered
|image:Enabled.png[Enabled,52,52]

|Disabled, Entered
|image:DisabledPlaying.png[alt=Disabled, Playing,width=52,height=52]

|Enabled, Entered
|image:EnabledPlaying.png[alt=Enabled, Playing,width=52,height=52]

|===

[[entered-message]]
=== Entered Message Menu

The menu:Entered Message[] Menu determines what kind of MIDI message
is sent when the first player moves into the cue (as long as the Cue’s
Track is Enabled), or when the last player that had been positioned
inside the cue moves out of it.

[NOTE]
====
The player does not need to actually be playing for
Entered/Exited messages to be sent: if the track loads and the player
auto-cues within the Cue, or the DJ uses cue/loop call, needle jump,
the jog wheel, or search to move into or out of the cue, its state
will update and the appropriate messages will be sent.

For cues within phrase triggers the situation is different because the
phrase trigger will only ever be active if the underlying phrase (and
track) are actually playing.
====

image:EnteredMessageMenu.png[Entered Message Menu,912,554]

None:: With this setting, which is the default, nothing is sent when
the Track loads or unloads.footnote:none[Note that this is different
from low-level Triggers, which always send something--you need to
remember to pick the kind of message to be sent for any Show events
that you want to respond to.] When `None` is chosen, there are no
interface elements visible to configure the message. They will appear
once you choose a message type to send.

Note:: With this setting, the Show sends a Note On message, with
velocity 127 and the note number shown to the right of the menu, when
the first player moves inside the Cue (as long as the Cue’s Track is
enabled), and a Note Off message when the last player that had been
inside the Cue moves back out of it, or the Track is disabled.
+
image:EnteredNote.png[Entered Note parameters,792,113]
+
The Channel on which the Entered/Exited messages are sent is
configured just to the right of the note selector.

CC:: With this setting, the Show sends a Control Change message, with
value 127 and the note number shown to the right of the menu, when the
first player moves inside the Cue (as long as the Cue’s Track is
enabled), and a CC with value 0 when the last player that had been
inside the Cue moves back out of it, or the Track is disabled.

Custom:: When this option is chosen, you can send any kind of message
you want when the Cue is entered and/or exited, by writing code as
described in the <<Expressions_ShowCue.adoc#,Expressions>>
section. This gives you the most flexibility because in addition to
MIDI messages, you can send arbitrary UDP packets, HTTP requests, or
whatever you might need. The expression editors for the Entered
Expression and Exited Expression are accessed through the
<<cue-context-menu,cue context menu>>.
+
If you choose `Custom` and have not yet written a Entered expression,
the expression editor will be opened to let you do that. You can
also open that editor using the <<cue-context-menu,cue context menu>>.

[[entered-note-spinner]]
==== Entered Note/Controller Spinner

Found immediately to the right of the menu:Entered Message[] Menu (unless
`None` is chosen as the Message type), this field lets you set the MIDI
note number used for Note-based  entered and exited messages, or the
controller number used for Control Change-based entered and exited
messages. The value is also available to your Cue expressions if they
want to use it.

[[entered-channel-spinner]]
==== Entered Channel Spinner

As described above, this lets you specify the MIDI channel on which
entered/exited messages are sent for this Cue.

[[started-status]]
=== Started Status

Below the Entered Status indicator there is an Started Status
indicator. Like the Entered Status indicator, it has two parts. The
outer ring indicates whether the Cue’s Track is currently enabled (a
green circle) or disabled (a red circle with a slash). If any player
is currently playing inside the Cue, there is a filled circle inside
the enabled indicator ring:

[width="50%",cols=".^,^.^",options="header"]

|Enabled, Started
|image:EnabledPlaying.png[alt=Enabled, Playing,width=52,height=52]

|===

[[started-on-beat-menu]]
=== Started On-Beat Message Menu

The menu:Started On-Beat Message[] Menu determines what kind of MIDI
message is sent when the first player begins playing the Cue, as long
as it does so from the very first beat of the Cue (and as long as the
Cue’s Track is enabled), or when the last player that had been playing
inside the cue moves out of it or the Track becomes disabled, if it
was started on its first beat.

image:StartedOnBeatMenu.png[Started On-Beat Message Menu,912,554]

None:: With this setting, which is the default, nothing is sent when
the Cue starts on its first beat or ends after having started that
way.footnote:none[] When `None` is chosen, there are no interface
elements visible to configure the message. They will appear once you
choose a message type to send.

Note:: With this setting, the Show sends a Note On message, with
velocity 127 and the note number shown to the right of the menu, when
the first player starts playing the Cue from its first beat (as long
as the Cue’s Track is enabled), and a Note Off message when the last
player that had been playing the Cue stops doing so, or the Track is
disabled (as long as the Cue started playing from its first beat).
+
image:StartedOnBeatNote.png[Started On-Beat Note parameters,792,109]
+
The Channel on which the Started On-Beat/Ended messages are sent is
configured just to the right of the note selector.

CC:: With this setting, the Show sends a Control Change message, with
value 127 and the note number shown to the right of the menu, when the
first player starts playing the Cue from its first beat (as long as
the Cue’s Track is enabled), and a CC with value 0 when the last
player that had been playing the Cue stops doing so, or the Track is
disabled (as long as the Cue started playing from its first beat).

Custom:: When this option is chosen, you can send any kind of message
you want when the Cue is started on-beat and/or ended from that state,
by writing code as described in the
<<Expressions_ShowCue.adoc#,Expressions>> section. This gives
you the most flexibility because in addition to MIDI messages, you can
send arbitrary UDP packets, HTTP requests, or whatever you might need.
The expression editors for the Started Expression and Ended Expression
are accessed through the <<cue-context-menu,cue context menu>>.
+
If you choose `Custom` and have not yet written a Started On-Beat
expression, the expression editor will be opened to let you do that.
You can also open that editor using the <<cue-context-menu,cue
context menu>>.

[[started-on-beat-note-spinner]]
==== Started On-Beat Note/Controller Spinner

Found immediately to the right of the menu:Started On-Beat Message[]
Menu (unless `None` is chosen as the Message type), this field lets
you set the MIDI note number used for Note-based started on-beat and
ended messages, or the controller number used for Control Change-based
started on-beat and ended messages. The value is also available to
your Cue expressions if they want to use it.

[[started-on-beat-channel-spinner]]
==== Started On-Beat Channel Spinner

As described above, this lets you specify the MIDI channel on which
started on-beat/ended messages are sent for this Cue.

[[started-late-menu]]
=== Started Late Message Menu

The menu:Started Late Message[] Menu determines what kind of MIDI
message is sent when the first player begins playing the Cue, as long
as it missed playing the very first beat of the Cue (and as long as the
Cue’s Track is enabled), or when the last player that had been playing
inside the cue moves out of it or the Track becomes disabled, if it
was started somewhere after its first beat.

image:StartedLateMenu.png[Started Late Message Menu,912,554]

Same:: With this setting, which is the default, cues which start late
will be treated as if they had started playing with the initial beat
of the cue, so the settings of the menu:Started On-Beat Message[] Menu
will be used, and there are no separate interface elements visible to
configure the Late Message.
+
[TIP]
====

Most of the time you will want to leave the Late Message set to
`Same`. Unless you have a memory point or hot cue positioned precisely
at the beat, the only way you can be certain that the cue will be
detected as starting on-beat is if you are playing into it. And unless
it is a long cue, and you expect to have loops or memory points that
jump to later beats inside it that you want to treat differently, the
difference between starting on-beat and starting just after the beat
is not generally visible in the results triggered in the system you
are controlling via Beat Link Trigger.

====

None:: With this setting nothing is sent when the Cue starts after its
first beat or ends after having started that way.footnote:none[] When
`None` is chosen, there are no interface elements visible to configure
the message. They will appear once you choose a specific message type
to send.

Note:: With this setting, the Show sends a Note On message, with
velocity 127 and the note number shown to the right of the menu, when
the first player starts playing the Cue from somewhere past its first
beat (as long as the Cue’s Track is enabled), and a Note Off message
when the last player that had been playing the Cue stops doing so, or
the Track is disabled (as long as the Cue started playing after its
first beat).
+
image:StartedLateNote.png[Started Late Note parameters,789,110]
+
The Channel on which the Started Late/Ended messages are sent is
configured just to the right of the note selector.

CC:: With this setting, the Show sends a Control Change message, with
value 127 and the note number shown to the right of the menu, when the
first player starts playing the Cue from somewhere past its first beat
(as long as the Cue’s Track is enabled), and a CC with value 0 when
the last player that had been playing the Cue stops doing so, or the
Track is disabled (as long as the Cue started playing after its first
beat).

Custom:: When this option is chosen, you can send any kind of message
you want when the Cue is started late and/or ended from that state, by
writing code as described in the
<<Expressions_ShowCue.adoc#,Expressions>> section. This gives you the
most flexibility because in addition to MIDI messages, you can send
arbitrary UDP packets, HTTP requests, or whatever you might need. The
expression editors for the Started Expression and Ended Expression are
accessed through the <<cue-context-menu,cue context menu>>.
+
If you
choose `Custom` and have not yet written a Started Late expression,
the expression editor will be opened to let you do that. You can also
open that editor using the <<cue-context-menu,cue context menu>>.

[[started-late-note-spinner]]
==== Started Late Note/Controller Spinner

Found immediately to the right of the menu:Started Late Message[] Menu
(unless `Same` or `None` is chosen as the Message type), this field
lets you set the MIDI note number used for Note-based started late and
ended messages, or the controller number used for Control Change-based
started late and ended messages. The value is also available to your
Cue expressions if they want to use it.

[[started-late-channel-spinner]]
==== Started Late Channel Spinner

As described above, this lets you specify the MIDI channel on which
started late/ended messages are sent for this Cue.

[[cue-context-menu]]
=== Cue Context Menu

Each Cue row has a context menu attached to it, which can be accessed
by right-clicking (or control-clicking) anywhere on the row’s
background, but you can also open the context menu with a regular
mouse click on the button with a gear icon in it. Most of the menu is
devoted to editing various expressions to customize the Cue, as
described in the <<Expressions_ShowCue.adoc#,Expressions section>>.
The gear icon next to an expression will be filled in if that
expression has a value, and the gear in the button will be filled in
if any expression associated with the Cue has a value.

image:CueContextMenu.png[Context Menu,912,613]

The menu starts with the expression-related options, allowing you to
open editors to create or edit Clojure code that runs at well-defined
moments to customize the behavior of the Cue. These are followed by
the menu:Simulate[] submenu, which allows you to test your MIDI
mappings and custom expressions as described in the
<<cue-simulate,next section>>.

The menu:Inspect Expression Locals[] option allows you to explore any
values that have been set up by expressions in any Cue or the Track
itself to re-use or share with each other. See
<<Debugging.adoc#inspecting,Inspecting Locals and Globals>> for more
details.

Choosing menu:Scroll Waveform to This Cue[] does just what it sounds
like, ensuring that the cue is visible in the waveform display at the
top of the window. You can zoom the waveform out if you want to be
able to see more cues and context, or in if you want to see more
detail. See <<navigating-cues,Navigating Cues>> below for more
ways to find what you are looking for.

The menu:Duplicate Cue[] option makes a copy of the chosen Cue,
appending the word “Copy” (and possibly a number) to its name to keep
it unique. You can use this if you need to create several cues that
have common elements.

The menu:Add Cue to Library[] option adds the cue contents to the show
cue library, making it easy to create other cues in any track which
send the same messages. See <<Shows_CueLibrary.adoc#,The Cue Library>>
for more details.

****
If the cue is already in the library, this menu option will be
different. There are two separate cases:

* If the cue is exactly the same as when it was added to the library,
  then the menu option will be menu:Remove Cue from Library[], and
  will do exactly that.
* If the cue has been changed since it was added to the library, or
  you have created a new cue with the same name as one in the library
  but different content, the menu option will be
  menu:Update Cue in Library[], and choosing it will redefine the
  library cue to match the current one.
****

Finally, the menu:Delete Cue[] option does just what it sounds like,
after confirming that you want to discard any expressions and settings
you have configured for that Cue.

TIP: In addition to accessing the context menu from the cue row, you
can bring it up by right-clicking or control-clicking on the cue in
the waveform at the top of the window.

[[cue-simulate]]
=== Simulating Cue Events

The menu:Simulate[] submenu allows you to pretend that an Entered,
Exited, Started, Ended, Beat or Tracked Update event has occurred, and
send the corresponding MIDI messages and/or run the custom Expressions
you have configured for those situations.

image:CueSimulate.png[Cue Simulate Menu,435,352]

[TIP]
====

This can allow you to set up MIDI mappings in other software, like
Ableton Live, that requires actual MIDI messages in order to learn
them, even when you are working in offline mode because you don't
currently have access to your CDJs.

====

The corresponding option will be disabled if there is no MIDI message
or Expression configured for that event.

[[navigating-cues]]
== Navigating Cues

Beat Link Trigger tries to make it easy for you to find the cue you
want to work with. Here are some of the things that it does
automatically, and others you will likely find helpful to try when
working with a large number of cues.

* The list of cues is kept sorted by their start and end beats (and
  then their names, if you have multiple cues starting and ending on
  the same beat).

* You can type text in the `Filter` box at the top of the window to
  narrow the display to only cues whose name contain the text you
  typed.

* You can click the `Entered Only` check box to only show the cues
  that currently have players posititoned in them. This can be handy
  when you are running a show.

* When you create a new Cue, the list of cues is automatically
 scrolled to ensure the new cue is visible. (If your new cue is hidden
 by the `Filter` or `Entered Only` settings, Beat Link Trigger will
 pop up a dialog to remind you why you are not seeing it.) If needed,
 the track waveform at the top of the window is also scrolled to show
 the new cue.

* You can also scroll a Cue’s configuration row into view by clicking
  on the cue in the waveform display at the top of the window.

* Finally, as noted in the Context Menu section above, you can use a
  Cue’s context menu to scroll the waveform to reveal the cue within
  the track beat grid.

=== Scrolling and Zooming

Unless you happen to be using Auto-Scroll mode to have the cues editor
waveform follow the track's playback on a CDJ, you can of course use
the normal scroll bar to choose the part you want to see, and the Zoom
slider at the <<#cues-window,top of the window>> to control how much
of the waveform is visible at once. But if you have a great many cues
to enter or edit, you might want faster ways to get around without
having to lose your context and focus. http://maddix.it[Nicholas
Maddix] inspired some features that can help a lot:

* If you are using mouse with a vertical scroll wheel, rolling it
  while the mouse is inside the cues editor waveform will zoom the
  track in or out, keeping the same section under the mouse pointer if
  possible.

* If you are using a multi-touch track pad, you can use the vertical
  scroll gesture to zoom in and out while keeping the context under
  the mouse pointer fixed in the same way as with a scroll wheel.

* A horizontal scroll wheel (less common), or trackpad horizontal
  scrolling gesture, can be used to scroll the waveform left or right
  without moving out of the waveform down to the scroll bar.

* Finally, whenever there is a cues editor open on a track (as long as
  it is not in Auto-Scroll mode), the section of that track's waveform
  that is currently visible in the cues editor is highlighted with a
  white outline on the track overview in the Show window:
+
image:CuesViewportOutline.png[Cues viewport outline,700,160]
+
When you click anywhere in this full-track preview, the cues editor
waveform will scroll to center the section you clicked on. Dragging to
the left or right will scroll the cues editor waveform to the
corresponding point, and dragging up or down will zoom the cues editor
waveform out and in.

Learning these options will enable you to quickly get to exactly the
part of the waveform where you want to work on cues.

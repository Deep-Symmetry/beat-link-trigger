= Older Approaches
include::partial$PagePreamble.adoc[]

This section groups techniques that were developed using older
versions of Beat Link Trigger, before many important discoveries and
advances were made. They still work, but are usually not necessary;
there are easier ways of doing things today.

For example, because Crate Digger now makes it possible to get track
metadata even when there are four CDJs in use, there is not any reason
to go to the trouble of working with a DJ to set up a metadata cache
before a show.

The fact that we now can rely on metadata like this made it worth
building the Show interface to do the work of matching tracks and
arranging cues on them, which eliminates the need for the kinds of
clever tricks we previously used to try to manually recognize them.
And there's now a built-in playlist writer that does a more thorough
job than the sample code shown at the end of the Matching Tracks
section.

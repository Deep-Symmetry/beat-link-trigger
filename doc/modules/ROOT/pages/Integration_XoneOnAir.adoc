= Xone:96 Channels On Air Support
include::partial$PagePreamble.adoc[]

This started as a request for assistance on the Beat Link project, but
it turns out at least one Beat Link Trigger user also has this great
mixer, and missed the On Air display that CDJs only give when talking
to DJMs. But since the Xone:96 can send MIDI events to report the
positions of its faders, by plugging in a USB cable you can have Beat
Link Trigger translate those into Channels On Air messages that update
the CDJ lights for you.

[[xone-v1]]
== First Version

To make it easy to turn this feature on and off along with other
things you are doing in Beat Link Trigger, I created a standalone show
file that implements the integration. If you have that show open, it
tries to translate mixer MIDI into CDJ on-air messages, and if you
close it, it stops. The show looks a little strange because it has no
tracks, but it doesn't need any, all the action happens in the Shared
Functions and the Came Online and Going Offline Expressions.

To try it out, start by saving the
link:{attachmentsdir}/XoneOnAirNoUI.bls[Xone On Air show] where you like
to keep your Beat Link Trigger shows, then open it. Assuming your
mixer is plugged into a USB port, it should start working. Move
channel faders up and down, and move the cross-fader back and forth,
and your CDJs should change color appropriately (as long as you have
the On Air feature enabled on the CDJs themselves, and Beat Link
Trigger is online and talking to them).

NOTE: If the mixer wasn't connected, you will see an error dialog
about the MIDI device not being found when Beat Link Trigger goes
online with the show open. Plug in the mixer, then take BLT offline
and back online, and things should work better. If it still complains,
your MIDI device must be named differently than expected: the show is
looking for a port with "XONE" in the name. Figure out what your
mixer's MIDI port is called on your system, then edit line 3 of the
Came Online Expression so it is a substring that matches only that
port, and try again.

As shipped, the show assumes channels 1 and 2 are tied to the left
side of the cross fader, and 3 and 4 to the right, but that is easily
edited at the top of the Shared Functions, as shown in the code
listing <<xone-shared,below>>.

[TIP]
====
For the channel on-air messages to affect your correct CDJs, you need
to make sure each CDJ is displaying the actual mixer channel number
that it is connected to. That happens automatically if you plug them
into a DJM-2000, but most people have to set them manually.

Here are some instructions from the Pioneer forum about assigning
player channel numbers. You need to have the network cable and all USB
connections (cables and media sticks) disconnected for this to work:

. Power on your CDJ
. Press and hold the "MENU" button on the top (This enters the Utility mode)
. Use the control knob to scroll down through the list until you reach "Player No."
. Press down on the knob to select it
. Scroll through your available channels (Auto, 1, 2, 3, 4)
. Press down on the knob to select your desired channel
. Press the "MENU" button again to exit the Utility setting

It may be necessary to wait a few seconds while an existing "Auto"
selection assigns your player number before you can edit it. And
again, You must have all LAN and USB connections removed in order to
assign the player number.

If you are curious how the Xone:96 On-Air show actually works, here is
all the code!

[[xone-shared]]
.Shared Functions
[source,clojure]
----
include::example$xone-shared-noui.clj[]
----

<1> Any channel numbers listed in this set will be considered off the
air when the cross fader is all the way to the right.

<2> Any channel numbers listed in this set will be considered off the
air when the cross fader is all the way to the left. (If you omit any
channels numbers from both sets, they will be unaffected by the cross
fader.)

<3> You can change this value to adjust how far from the end of a
fader a channel goes off the air. The MIDI values for the faders run
from 0 to 127.

<4> The rest of this code is functions that are called when MIDI
events arrive from the mixer to decide how they affect the channels.
Hopefully the inline comments show how they work.

.Global Setup Expression
[source,clojure]
----
;; Make sure we are running a new enough version of Beat Link Trigger
;; for this show to work correctly.
(show/require-version show "0.5.5-SNAPSHOT-76")

;; Make the UI understand that this show does not use tracks.
(show/block-tracks show true)

;; Track the current state we believe the mixer to have. Will not be
;; accurate for a given fader until it is moved. We assume all channels
;; are on the air until we get actual data.
(swap! globals assoc
  :cross-fader 63
  :channel-1  127
  :channel-2  127
  :channel-3  127
  :channel-4  127)
----

This code runs after the shared functions have been defined, when the
show is starting up. It first makes sure that it is running in a
recent enough version of Beat Link Trigger to work properly. If not, a
dialog explaining that is displayed, and the show is closed.

NOTE: If you are running an even older version of Beat Link Trigger,
the `require-version` check will not exist, and you will see a
compilation error reported instead. Either way, you should upgrade to
a newer version, and things will be reported more nicely from now on.

It also tweaks the Show window slightly, changing the **Tracks** menu
to an **Expressions** menu, which omits the **Import Tracks** submenu:
this show does not have any need to import tracks or create cues for
them, it simply talks to a mixer over MIDI. This also removes options
in any other shows' track context menus which would offer to copy the
tracks to this show.

It then sets up some assumed values for the mixer's channel faders and
cross fader, which will be replaced with actual values as soon as we
receive MIDI from the mixer reporting their movement.

.Came Online Expression
[source,clojure]
----
include::example$xone-online-noui.clj[]
----

This is run whenever Beat Link Trigger is brought online, (or, if it
was already online when the show is opened, it is run right after the
Global Setup expression). It tries to connect to the mixer, and sets
up to be informed whenever faders are moved, so we can figure out
which channels are on the air.

<1> This is where you edit the mixer MIDI port name if it doesn't
contain "XONE" on your system.

<2> This is the code that displays the error window when the MIDI port
can't be found.

.Going Offline Expression
[source,clojure]
----
include::example$xone-offline.clj[lines=1..6]
----

This code runs when Beat Link Trigger is being taken offline (or the
show is closing with BLT still online), and closes the mixer's MIDI
port gracefully if it was open.

== Experimenting Without the Mixer

I don't actually have a Xone:96, so to develop this code I had to make
a "fake one" based on its
https://www.allen-heath.com/content/uploads/2023/06/X96_MIDI-Control-Overview.pdf[MIDI
mapping manual], which I did in the form of a Max patch. If you have
Max, you can link:{attachmentsdir}/XoneSimulator.maxpat[save it] and
play with it too. It has four simulated channel faders and a cross
fader:

image:XoneSimulator.png[Xone:96 Simulator,674,659]

I set my environment up so that MIDI output port `c` in Max had a name
that matched what the Global Setup Expression was looking for, and I
could control my CDJ's on-air lights by sliding the faders in the
patch.

NOTE: https://github.com/GuyHarwood[@GuyHardwood], who was the
inspiration for this integration, discovered through MIDI Monitor that
the official documentation is incorrect about the CC number used for
the cross-fader. It appears to actually be 4 rather than 5.

[[xone-v2]]
== Second Version, with GUI

As mentioned above, while I was working on this show I realized there
were probably many other kinds of integrations that would be
convenient to share as show files but which had nothing to do with
tracks. So I added the mechanism that turns off the import tracks
feature, but that left most of the show window empty, with a useless
menu:Enabled Default[] menu and Filter box at the top. And building
the mixer simulator I used for testing made me wish I could have a
similar UI in the show itself, to show what is going on with the
mixer. And I realized that it would only take a few small additions to
Beat Link Trigger to enable me (and anyone) to build things like that,
so I added them!

Here is what the final result looks like in action:

image:XoneShowUI.png[Xone:96 Show UI,574,504]

The top row shows the mixer channels that are currently calculated as
being on the air by lighting them up in red. Immediately below that is
a row of controls that allow you to tell the show which side of the
cross-fader each channel has been assigned on the mixer, just like the
physical switches above the faders on the mixer itself. If the switch
is in the middle, the channel is unaffected by the cross-fader. If it
is on the left (X) or right (Y) side, then the channel is heard when
the cross-fader is on that side.

Below these are the channel numbers, and below those are MIDI activity
indicators whose centers flash blue whenever the mixer reports motion
on that channel fader. At the same time, the graphical representation
of the channel fader will jump to where the mixer reported, and the
on-air indicators will update. If the show's channel faders are not in
the right place (because the mixer was adjusted while this show was
not open or online), you can either drag the GUI version to the right
spot using your mouse, or just wiggle the physical mixer channel
fader, which will send MIDI events that snap the GUI for that channel
into the right place.

Finally, at the bottom is the MIDI indicator and GUI representation of
the cross-fader position, which works the same way. The positions of
the X-Y selectors and faders are saved when you close the show, so
they will appear in the same place as you left them, and you will
rarely need to tweak anything by editing expression code.

Save the link:{attachmentsdir}/XoneOnAir.bls[full-featured GUI
version] where you keep your shows and you can start using it, but for
those of you who want to know how it works, let's take a tour of the
code!

The <<xone-shared-v2,Shared Functions>> are much larger in this
version, because that is where all the GUI elements are constructed,
so we will save them for last. The Global Setup Expression is actually
simpler here:

.Global Setup Expression
[source,clojure]
----
;; Make sure we are running a new enough version of Beat Link Trigger
;; for this show to work correctly.
(show/require-version show "0.5.5-SNAPSHOT-83")  ;; <1>

;; Make the UI understand that this show does not use tracks, and
;; build and install the custom GUI that takes over the window.
(show/block-tracks show (xone-build-ui show globals))  ;; <2>
----

<1> This show needs a newer version of BLT, because it takes advantage
of new features for drawing the UI and saving settings. But that also
means the section that set up default values for the fader positions
is no longer necessary.

<2> In addition to telling BLT this show doesn't import any tracks,
the `show/block-tracks` function can install a custom user interface
to be drawn as the content of the window. We achieve that by calling a
new Shared Function here that creates and returns that custom
interface.

The Came Online expression is almost identical to the previous
version, and only needed one additional line:

.Came Online Expression
[source,clojure]
----
include::example$xone-online-gui.clj[]
----

<1> This line, which starts up a background thread to draw and fade
out the MIDI activity indicators is the only thing that is different
from the first version. The implementation of the function itself is
in the Shared Functions, of course.

Similarly, there is only one addition needed to the Going Offline
expression:

.Going Offline Expression
[source,clojure]
----
include::example$xone-offline.clj[]
----

<1> This new line redraws the MIDI activity indicators after the mixer
connection has been closed, which gives them an obvious "offline"
appearance.

We do this because the act of closing the mixer connection also
terminates the background thread that is animating the indicators, so
it won't have a chance to reflect this change. All this stuff is done
with our new Shared Functions, so let's take a look at them.

[[xone-shared-v2]]
.Shared Functions, part 1
[source,clojure]
----
include::example$xone-shared-gui.clj[lines=1..30]
----

<1> This is the only variable definition we still need from the
original version, because the rest are now managed by stored settings
controlled by graphical elements in the interface. Tweaking this one
value still requires you to edit code.

<2> This function is almost identical to its old version. The comment
explains that the value comes from a different place than it used to
(the new saved show data rather than globals), and we added a default
value of `0` to the `get` for when no data has yet been saved in the
show.

<3> Again, nearly identical to the non-GUI version, but it is
receiving saved show data, and here is where the default values of the
channel assignments come from if the data isn't yet saved.

But that's the end of familiar stuff for a long while. Now we get into
the new part that builds the graphical user interface.

[[xone-shared-v2-p2]]
.Shared Functions, part 2
[source,clojure]
----
include::example$xone-shared-gui.clj[lines=32..55]
----

<1> This code used to be part of `xone-midi-received`. That function
still exists below, but now the calculation of what channels are on
the air, and sending the results to the CDJs, happens in response to
the graphical faders moving because that can be caused by the user
dragging them or by MIDI events.

<2> This function creates the numbers that appear above the channel
faders. BLT uses https://github.com/daveray/seesaw[Seesaw] to provide
a Clojure wrapper around Java Swing GUI components, and
http://www.miglayout.com[MIG Layout] to arrange them.

.Shared Functions, part 3
[source,clojure]
----
include::example$xone-shared-gui.clj[lines=57..92]
----

<1> This function reacts to the user changing the position of one of
the X-Y channel assignment controls to update the saved show data that
keeps track of which channels belong on which side. It then calls
<<xone-shared-v2-p2,`xone-recompute-on-air`>> because of course
changing channel assignments can affect which channels are on the air.

<2> This function builds the actual X-Y channel assignment controls
themselves, and hooks them up to the previous function.

.Shared Functions, part 4
[source,clojure]
----
include::example$xone-shared-gui.clj[lines=94..115]
----

<1> Similarly, this function reacts to the user (or an incoming MIDI
message) changing the position of one of the faders (channel or
cross-fader). All it needs to do is call
<<xone-shared-v2-p2,`xone-recompute-on-air`>>.

<2> And this function builds the channel fader controls themselves and
hooks them up to the previous function.

There is more GUI code in the Shared Functions which you can look at
if you download the show and poke around in the expression editors.
Hopefully this discussion provides enough of an introduction and
framework to help understand how it works.

= Importing Libraries
include::partial$PagePreamble.adoc[]

Although Beat Link Trigger includes many useful libraries for things
like working with MIDI and Open Sound Control, there are going to be
situations where you would like to use something that isn't already
built in. To support that, there is now a mechanism that lets you
dynamically load any Java (or Clojure, or other JVM language) library
that you have locally on your machine (in the form of a Jar file or
directory of classes), or that exists in a Maven repository on the
Internet.

TIP: You need to be connected to the Internet the first time you try
to load a library from a repository, but from then on it will be in
your local Maven cache, so you will be able to access it even when
offline.

For example, suppose you are building an integration where you want to
be able to write out JSON files. BLT doesn't include that ability out
of the box, but there is a nice Clojure library,
https://github.com/clojure/data.json[data.json], that offers it.
Looking at the project page, we can see that it has a Leiningen
dependency "`coordinate`" of `[org.clojure/data.json "0.2.6"]`.
Leiningen is a very common tool for managing library dependencies in
Clojure projects, and that format is what the BLT library loader uses
as well. To make this library available, add this to the Shared
Functions:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(add-library '[org.clojure/data.json "0.2.6"])
(require '[clojure.data.json :as json])
----

(The Leiningen coordinate needs to be preceded by a single quote mark
for Clojure to parse it properly.) Assuming you are connected to the
Internet, the first line will download the data.json library, and any
libraries that it needs for its own use, and add them to the class
path so your expressions can access them.

The second line loads the main namespace of the data.json library, and
aliases it under the name `json` to make it more convenient for your
expressions to call its functions.

At this point, your expressions can do things like:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(json/write-str {:a 1 :b 2})
----

Which returns a string holding the JSON representation of the Clojure
map. See the library's https://clojure.github.io[API documentation]
for more details.

If you want to add multiple libraries, you can call call `add-library`
multiple times, or in a slightly more compact and efficient variation,
call `add-libraries` instead and pass a vector of all the coordinates
(put another set of square brackets around them), like so:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(add-libraries '[[org.clojure/data.json "0.2.6"]
                 [incanter "1.9.3"]])
(require '[clojure.data.json :as json])
(require '[incanter/incanter-core :as incanter])
----

Notice that you still need individual `require` statements for all the
Clojure libraries you want to actually load and/or give short aliases
to. Java libraries don't need `require` statements but you might want
to `import` some of their classes to save typing.

WARNING: Adding libraries like this, while very powerful, is also
fraught with peril. Beyond vetting that the library seems to be
well-written and safe, and that your network connection is good the
first time you try it, there are a number of scenarios in which
`add-library` will not work, or will not work as you'd expect, because
of the nature of JVM classloaders. If any of the jars you add provide
conflicting versions of an existing Beat Link Trigger dependency, this
will lead to very bad results. So when this works, it can let you add
new features quickly, but if it doesn't, ask for help from the
https://gitter.im/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger[Gitter Chat community]
to see if there might be another library that would work better, or if
the functionality you need can be safely incorporated in a future
release.

If you need to load a dependency from a repository other than Clojars
or Maven Central, you can tell `add-library` where to look by merging
the description of your repository with the default repositories, like
this:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(add-library '[com.mycompany/cool "0.0.1"]
             :repositories (merge default-repositories
                                  {"my repo name" "https://repo.mycompany.com"}))
----

Of course you would replace the example repository name and URL with
the actual name and URL of the repository you want to add.

== Local Libraries

If you have a library already downloaded as a standalone Jar file (or
directory hierarchy of class files and resources), you can use it by
adding it to the Beat Link Trigger class path, like in this example:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(extend-classpath "/Users/james/git/wayang/wayang-0.1.7.jar")
----

WARNING: In addition to the caveats described above about adding
libraries in general, the low-level `extend-classpath` function
doesn't give you any feedback if the path you entered for the file or
directory is incorrect; you will simply not find the library classes
you were hoping would be available when your code tries to use them.

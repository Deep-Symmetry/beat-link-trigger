= Show Shared Functions
include::partial$PagePreamble.adoc[]

Starting with version 0.5 you can use <<Shows.adoc#,Show files>> to
more conveniently perform actions when specific sections of particular
tracks are played. Shows have their own sets of expressions, which we
cover next.

The Tracks menu at the top of a Show window lets you define
expressions that can manage values you want to make available to all
your other expressions within the Show. Most of them are described in
the <<Expressions_ShowGlobal.adoc#,next section>>, but we will look at
how to set up shared functions for use in all your show expressions
here.

Just like in the Triggers window, if you start writing complex
expressions in your Show, you will find yourself repeating common
pieces of code over and over again in multiple expressions. The best
way to deal with that is to pull out the repetetive part and write it
as a function, which can then be called from any expression that wants
to use it. In Clojure, you use `defn` to define a function, and
choosing menu:Tracks[Edit Shared Functions] brings up an editor window
that is where you should organize all of the shared functions you want
your Show expressions to use.

The Shared Functions will be loaded before any of your expressions are
compiled.

TIP: If you are going to be using the functions only in Triggers
expressions, define them using menu:Triggers[Edit Shared Functions] in
the Triggers window instead. Even though they get compiled into the
same `beat-link-triggers.expressions` namespace, putting them in the
Triggers window means they will be saved independently of the Show,
and will work even if the Show was never opened, or if you share the
Triggers with someone else. If you need them in both your Show and
Triggers expressions, put them in both places. Redefining a function
is harmless, although make sure you have exactly the same definition
in both places or you will confuse yourself!

For a detailed (and amusing) look at defining and using shared
functions in a show, check out the
<<Integration_BreakBuddy.adoc#,Break Buddy>> integration example.

<<ImportingLibraries.adoc#,import libraries>> for use in your
expressions.

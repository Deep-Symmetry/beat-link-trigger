Customize and extend Beat Link Trigger by writing code in Clojure,
the language used to implement the program itself.

== Overview

A great deal of the power of Beat Link Trigger is in what you can do
with custom expressions. The user interface lets you configure
triggers to send simple MIDI messages in response to basic state
changes, but with expressions you can write your own logic to
determine when the trigger should be enabled, using all of the
information provided by the DJ Link protocol, and you can even send
other kinds of messages locally or over the network to integrate with
systems that do not respond to MIDI.

NOTE: Expressions are written in http://clojure.org[Clojure], the same
language that was used to write Beat Link Trigger. When you write one,
it gets compiled to Java byte-code and loaded, essentially becoming
part of Beat Link Trigger as if it had been there all along. So you
have access to the full power of the language and Java environment,
and can do anything you need to. But you will need to learn a little
Clojure to do it. The official
https://clojure.org/guides/learn/syntax[Learn Clojure] page is a good
starting point, and there are many
https://clojure.org/community/resources[Resources] and
https://clojure.org/community/books[Books] if you decide you want to
go deep. https://www.maria.cloud[Maria] is a fun, interactive online
workbook that progressively introduces the language through exercises
with instant feedback—and better support and guidance when errors
happen than the language itself provides. It’s worth checking out.

If you are working with the new Show interface, rather than low-level
Triggers, then the expressions you’ll be using are at the
<<Expressions#show-global-expressions,end of this section>>, but you
should at least skim the Triggers expression explanations too, because
they introduce some important concepts that are useful everywhere.

=== With Great Power comes Great Responsibility

WARNING: The code you write in expressions gets compiled into Beat
Link Trigger in the same way as the program itself was written. This
gives you great power, but it also means you can completely lock up
the program if you change the wrong things or get stuck in an infinite
loop. It’s important to start simple, and to keep in mind that your
expressions run as part of processing network updates from players and
mixers, so they need to finish fast.

Beat Link Trigger tries to protect against many kinds of things that
can go wrong in your expressions. If one throws an exception, it will
be logged so you can view it in the log file, and that instance of
calling your expression will be abruptly cancelled, but the next
expression or activity will get a chance to run.

The real problem is when your code does something that takes a long
time, or even worse, gets stuck in an infinite loop. If that happens,
nothing else that is supposed to respond to the event that caused your
expression to run will get a chance to, and events can pile up behind
your stuck expression, freezing user interface updates, and blocking
the MIDI or other messages you are supposed to be sending. So watch
for that, and remember which expressions you have changed recently if
things go badly wrong.

If you legitimately need to do something in an expression that could
take a long time, such as an HTTP request, or any other sort of
round-trip network communication, you need to make it asynchronous by
wrapping the potentially-slow operation in a Clojure `(future …)`
block. This will run in a separate thread, so it will not slow down
the expression, or the delivery of events to other triggers, shows,
cues, or the user interface.

The tricky part about using `future` to run your code asynchronously
is when you need to do something with whatever answer you got back
from your long-running operation. You can’t just return it, like you
would in a simple, direct expression, because the expression has
already moved on, it did not wait for the answer. The easiest solution
is to have your asynchronous code inside the `future` block record the
answer into an expression local or global, and then other expressions
(or even future invocations of this expression) can check the local or
global to see if the answer is ready, and use it when it is. That is a
quick operation. So as long as your code works (even if it doesn’t yet
do anything) while the answer is still missing, it can use it without
blocking other activity as soon as it becomes available in the
expression local or global.

TIP: There aren’t any examples of this kind of asynchronous code in
the user guide yet, but if you have a situation where you need one,
ask in the https://gitter.im/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger[Gitter chat],
and perhaps we can turn your needs into a new example for future
releases.

Also, note that it is only sending two-way network communications that
you need to worry about. Sending MIDI messages and short one-way UDP
messages (like OSC and some lighting controllers use) should be no
problem without resorting to asynchronous code, and you will find
examples of doing just that throughout this guide.


[[editing-expressions]]
== Editing Expressions

The expression you are first likely to want to use with low-level
Triggers is the Enabled Filter, which is found in each trigger’s
<<Triggers#context-menu,context menu>>. In fact, as soon as you set a
trigger’s menu:Enabled[] menu to Custom, Beat Link Trigger will pop
open the editor for that expression for you, if you have not yet
created it:

image:Editor.png[Enabled Filter Editor,912,828]

The editor window for each type of expression provides documentation
about the purpose of the expression and guidance on how to write it.
Most expression types have a variety of values that are available to
help you in writing the expression, and those are described and
explained in the help section as well.

Reading through the documentation, we see that the Enabled filter
should return a `true` value to enable the filter, and has access to a
lot of information about the watched player that it can use to decide.
Suppose we want the trigger to be enabled when the player has track
number 5 of a playlist or disc loaded, and has reached the fourth bar
of music (which starts on beat 17, since there are four beats per bar,
and the track starts with beat 1). With the help of
https://clojure.org/guides/learn/syntax[Learn Clojure] and the help
text in the editor window, we come up with the following expression:

image:EnabledExample.png[Enabled Example,631,400]

Try entering that as the Enabled Filter expression for your filter,
set the Enabled menu to Custom, and watch the Trigger Status indicator
as you load and play different tracks to confirm that it works!

Of course, as noted above, if you want something to happen when a
particular track reaches a particular beat, the <<Shows#shows,Show
interface>> is now a much easier and more powerful way to arrange
that. Still, read on for more basic expression editing concepts.

[TIP]
====
As you use the editor, you will notice that it provides syntax
coloring and parenthesis-matching help. But if you end up making a
mistake in your expression, Beat Link Trigger will likely report an
compilation error when you click kbd:[Update], and you can check the
<<Debugging#logs,log>> for a more detailed stack trace. You can try
searching the web for information about the error, or looking in the
Clojure https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[documentation], but
you can also ask for help in the Beat Link Trigger
https://gitter.im/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger[Gitter chat room].

If you are working with large expressions, you can focus on the part
you are interested in by using the little kbd:[-] box that appears
next to the line number of the first line of a multi-line expression.
This allows you to collapse the entire expression, letting you see
what comes on either side of it. Clicking the box again (which will
show as a kbd:[\+] sign now) will expand it again. If you hover the
mouse over the kbd:[+] without clicking on it, you can also peek at
the collapsed content as a tooltip. This feature can also be activated
using the menu:Folding[] submenu of the context menu, which appears
when you right-click or control-click in the editor text area.
====


=== The Editor Menus

Beat Link Trigger now offers a menu bar inside the expression editor
to access more powerful editing features. The menu:File[] menu makes
it easier to use a favorite (or more full-featured) external editor by
letting you save your expression to a text file for that editor to
work with, and load the results when you are done, or insert another
file at the current insertion point.

image:EditorFileMenu.png[Editor File Menu,230,140]

It also lets you update the expression when you have changed it,
compiling and loading the new version, or close the editor without
saving your changes.

The menu:Edit[] menu gives you access to the standard editing
capabilities that were formerly available in the context menu (which
you can bring up by right-clicking or control-clicking anywhere inside
the editor text area), and shows you their keyboard equivalents. You
might not even have known these features were available, although you
were probably already reflexively using the platform-standard editing
keys:

image:EditorEditMenu.png[Editor Edit Menu,205,180]

The menu:Search[] menu opens up special panes below the editor text
area that allow you to find and replace text, with control over case
sensitivity, whole-word matching, and the option to use regular
expressions. It also allows you to jump to a particular line by
number.

image:EditorSearchMenu.png[Editor Search Menu,260,95]

Finally, the Help menu is the same one available in most other
windows, giving you access to this guide along with other helpful
tools and information.


[[shared-functions]]
== Shared Functions

Once you start writing more complex expressions, you may find yourself
repeating common pieces of code over and over again in multiple
expressions. The best way to deal with that is to pull out the
repetetive part and write it as a function, which can then be called
from any expression that wants to use it. In Clojure, you use `defn`
to define a function, and choosing menu:Triggers[Edit Shared
Functions] brings up an editor window that is where you should
organize all of the shared functions you want your Triggers
expressions to use.

The Shared Functions will be loaded before any of your expressions are
compiled.

TIP: If you are going to be using the functions in Show expressions,
define them using menu:Tracks[Edit Shared Functions] in the Show
window instead. Even though they get compiled into the same
`beat-link-triggers.expressions` namespace, putting them in the Show
means they will be saved as part of the Show, so if you share the Show
with someone else, the expressions will still work. If you need them
in both your Show and Triggers expressions, put them in both places so
the Triggers expressions will work even if the Show isn't open.
Redefining a function is harmless, although make sure you have exactly
the same definition in both places or you will confuse yourself!

TODO: Link to example, e.g. Break Buddy.

[[importing-libraries]]
== Importing Libraries

Although Beat Link Trigger includes many useful libraries for things
like working with MIDI and Open Sound Control, there are going to be
situations where you would like to use something that isn't already
built in. To support that, there is now a mechanism that lets you
dynamically load any Java (or Clojure, or other JVM language) library
that you have locally on your machine (in the form of a Jar file or
directory of classes), or that exists in a Maven repository on the
Internet.

TIP: You need to be connected to the Internet the first time you try
to load a library from a repository, but from then on it will be in
your local Maven cache, so you will be able to access it even when
offline.

For example, suppose you are building an integration where you want to
be able to write out JSON files. BLT doesn't include that ability out
of the box, but there is a nice Clojure library,
https://github.com/clojure/data.json[data.json], that offers it.
Looking at the project page, we can see that it has a Leiningen
dependency "`coordinate`" of `[org.clojure/data.json "0.2.6"]`.
Leiningen is a very common tool for managing library dependencies in
Clojure projects, and that format is what the BLT library loader uses
as well. To make this library available, add this to the Shared
Functions:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(add-library '[org.clojure/data.json "0.2.6"])
(require '[clojure.data.json :as json])
----

(The Leiningen coordinate needs to be preceded by a single quote mark
for Clojure to parse it properly.) Assuming you are connected to the
Internet, the first line will download the data.json library, and any
libraries that it needs for its own use, and add them to the class
path so your expressions can access them.

The second line loads the main namespace of the data.json library, and
aliases it under the name `json` to make it more convenient for your
expressions to call its functions.

At this point, your expressions can do things like:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(json/write-str {:a 1 :b 2})
----

Which returns a string holding the JSON representation of the Clojure
map. See the library's http://clojure.github.com/data.json/[API
documentation] for more details.

If you want to add multiple libraries, you can call call `add-library`
multiple times, or in a slightly more compact and efficient variation,
call `add-libraries` instead and pass a vector of all the coordinates
(put another set of square brackets around them), like so:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(add-libraries '[[org.clojure/data.json "0.2.6"]
                 [incanter "1.9.3"]])
(require '[clojure.data.json :as json])
(require '[incanter/incanter-core :as incanter])
----

Notice that you still need individual `require` statements for all the
Clojure libraries you want to actually load and/or give short aliases
to. Java libraries don't need `require` statements but you might want
to `import` some of their classes to save typing.

WARNING: Adding libraries like this, while very powerful, is also
fraught with peril. Beyond vetting that the library seems to be
well-written and safe, and that your network connection is good the
first time you try it, there are a number of scenarios in which
`add-library` will not work, or will not work as you'd expect, because
of the nature of JVM classloaders. If any of the jars you add provide
conflicting versions of an existing Beat Link Trigger dependency, this
will lead to very bad results. So when this works, it can let you add
new features quickly, but if it doesn't, ask for help from the
https://gitter.im/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger[Gitter Chat community]
to see if there might be another library that would work better, or if
the functionality you need can be safely incorporated in a future
release.

If you need to load a dependency from a repository other than Clojars
or Maven Central, you can tell `add-library` where to look by merging
the description of your repository with the default repositories, like
this:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(add-library '[com.mycompany/cool "0.0.1"]
             :repositories (merge default-repositories
                                  {"my repo name" "https://repo.mycompany.com"}))
----

Of course you would replace the example repository name and URL with
the actual name and URL of the repository you want to add.

[[local-libraries]]
=== Local Libraries

If you have a library already downloaded as a standalone Jar file (or
directory hierarchy of class files and resources), you can use it by
adding it to the Beat Link Trigger class path, like in this example:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(extend-classpath "/Users/james/git/wayang/wayang-0.1.7.jar")
----

WARNING: In addition to the caveats described above about adding
libraries in general, the low-level `extend-classpath` function
doesn't give you any feedback if the path you entered for the file or
directory is incorrect; you will simply not find the library classes
you were hoping would be available when your code tries to use them.

[[global-expressions]]
== Triggers Global Expressions

The Triggers menu at the top of the window lets you define two
expressions that can manage values you want to make available to all
your other Trigger expressions.

To support that, all Trigger expressions have access to a Clojure
http://clojure.org/reference/atoms[atom] named `globals` that is
shared with all other Trigger expressions, so that’s a great place to
put things for them to find. The atom starts out holding an empty
http://clojure.org/reference/data_structures#Maps[map], which allows
you to add key/value pairs to organize the information you want to
share across expressions.

[[global-setup-expression]]
=== Global Setup Expression

This is run when Beat Link Trigger starts up, or when you open a new
Trigger file, so it runs before any of your individual trigger
expressions. As a simple example of what you might want to do, here is
an expression opens the Player Status window:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(beat-link-trigger.triggers/show-player-status)
----

Setting this as your Global Setup Expression will automatically open
the Player Status window whenever Beat Link Trigger launches. (This
also makes sure subsystems like the `TimeFinder` are running, which
can be helpful if you are writing other expressions that depend on
knowing the playback position of tracks.)

If you ever start up BLT in offline mode with this Global Setup
Expression in place, however, you will be presented with an error
dialog, complaining "`Must be Online to show Player Status window.`"
To avoid being inconvenienced by that, we can make the expression
smarter, so it only tries to open Player Status when already Online:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(when (.isRunning (VirtualCdj/getInstance))  {conum-guard-clojure} <1>
  (beat-link-trigger.triggers/show-player-status))  {conum-guard-clojure} <2>
----

<1> A `when` clause in Clojure only executes its body if a test
expression returns a true value. In this case we ask the Beat Link
`VirtualCdj` object if it is running, which is only true when Beat
Link Trigger is online.

<2> This means the expression body, which is the same as our first
attempt at opening Player Status, is only run when it is safe to do
so.

But there is an even better way to do this, now that version 0.5.4 has
added the <<came-online-expression,Came Online Expression>> which runs
once Beat Link Trigger has successfully connected to a DJ Link
network. Using that expression to show the Player Status window means
it will always be safe to try, and -- even better -- the window will
be reopened every time you go back online, not just when initially
starting the program.

Here is an even more sophisticated example that creates a
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/DatagramSocket.html[`DatagramSocket`]
for sending a remote trigger command to the ChamSys MagicQ lighting
control software using its
https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/ch31.html[remote
protocol]:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(let [chamsys-address (InetSocketAddress.  {conum-guard-clojure} <1>
                       (InetAddress/getByName "172.16.42.255") 6553)
      trigger-on (byte-array (map int "71,1H"))  {conum-guard-clojure} <2>
      trigger-off (byte-array (map int "71,0H"))]
  (swap! globals assoc  {conum-guard-clojure} <3>
         :chamsys-socket (DatagramSocket.)  {conum-guard-clojure} <4>
         :chamsys-on (DatagramPacket. trigger-on (count trigger-on)  {conum-guard-clojure} <5>
                                      chamsys-address)
         :chamsys-off (DatagramPacket. trigger-off (count trigger-off)
                                      chamsys-address)))
----

This begins with a `let` binding which sets up some values that will
be used later in the expression.

<1> `chamsys-address` gets set to a
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/SocketAddress.html[`SocketAddress`]
representing port 6553 (the default port used by MagicQ) on the
broadcast address for the Deep Symmetry show network (you will need to
use the value appropriate for your own network).

<2> `trigger-on` and `trigger-off` are arrays of bytes containing the
characters that make up the commands for turning a MagicQ remote
programming trigger on and off.

<3> Those values are then used in the
http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/swap![`swap!`]
call, which is the way you modify a Clojure atom. In this case we are
modifying the map in `globals` by using
http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/assoc[`assoc`]
to add some new key-value pairs to it:

<4> `:chamsys-socket` gets associated with a newly-allocated
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/DatagramSocket.html[`DatagramSocket`]
that triggers will be able to use for sending UDP messages to MagicQ,

<5> and the actual command packets are created as
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/DatagramPacket.html[`DatagramPacket`]
objects preconfigured with the correct command bytes and destination
address and port, in `:chamsys-on` and `:chamsys-off`.

The <<track-beat-expression,Beat Expression>> below shows how these
globals are actually used.

[[came-online-expression]]
=== Came Online Expression

This is run whenever Beat Link Trigger has successfully connected to a
DJ Link network, either at initial startup or when you have told it
manually to go online. At initial startup, or whenever you open a new
Triggers file, it will run after the <<global-setup-expression,Global
Setup expression>> as long as you are online. It runs by itself when
you choose menu:Network[Online?] to successfully transition from an
offline to an online state.

You have access to the expression globals if you need to use anything
in them.

This is the perfect place to take actions that can only succeed when
Beat Link Trigger is online, such as opening the Player Status window.
The simplest approach described <<global-setup-expression,above>> is
safe to use in this expression, unlike in the Global Setup expression:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(beat-link-trigger.triggers/show-player-status)
----

With this in place, every time you successfully go online, either at
startup or using menu:Network[Online?], the Player Status window will
open for you.

Another example came up in the
https://gitter.im/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger[community chat room],
from a user who wanted to set up a turn-key lighting system that
automatically started Beat Link Trigger and Carabiner. If you are in a
situation like that, and can be sure that Carabiner has already been
started by the time Beat Link Triger launches, you can set up a Came
Online Expression to automatically open the Carabiner window and
connect to it:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(beat-link-trigger.carabiner/show-window nil)  {conum-guard-clojure} <1>
(beat-link-trigger.carabiner/connect)  {conum-guard-clojure} <2>
(beat-link-trigger.carabiner/sync-mode :passive)  {conum-guard-clojure} <3>
(beat-link-trigger.carabiner/sync-link true)  {conum-guard-clojure} <4>
(beat-link-trigger.carabiner/align-bars true)  {conum-guard-clojure} <5>
----

<1> Opens the Carabiner window.

<2> Tries to connect to the Carabiner daemon.

<3> <<Link#passive-sync,Allows>> the DJ Link network to become Tempo
Master for Ableton Link. Other choices are `:off`,
<<Link#syncing-triggers,`:triggers`>>, and <<Link#full-sync,`:full`>>.

<4> Causes Ableton Link to actually follow the DJ Link Tempo Master.

<5> Aligns Ableton Link and the DJ Link network at the level of entire
four-beat measures, rather than simple beat alignment.

NOTE: If you are using the above Carabiner configuration functions in
an expression, you need to perform the first three steps in the order
they are shown, because each will only work when the preceding step
has been succesfully accomplished. Functions 4 and 5 can be called in
any order.

[[going-offline-expression]]
=== Going Offline Expression

This is run whenever Beat Link Trigger is online and you manually take
it offline by choosing menu:Network[Online?], exit the program, open a
new Trigger file, or choose to delete all triggers. In any of the
situations where you are doing more than just going offline, it runs
right before the <<global-shutdown-expression,Global Shutdown
expression>>. It gives you a chance to gracefully close any
connections and release any system resources you allocated in your
<<came-online-expression,Came Online Expression>>.

You have access to the expression globals if you need to use anything
in them.

[[global-shutdown-expression]]
=== Global Shutdown Expression

This is run when Beat Link Trigger is exiting, or before it opens a
new Trigger file (or when you choose to delete all triggers). It gives
you a chance to close any connections and release any system resources
that you allocated in your <<global-setup-expression,Global Setup
Expression>>. Here is how we would do that for the ChamSys MagicQ
example we started above:

```clojure
(.close (:chamsys-socket @globals))
```

This simply looks up the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/DatagramSocket.html[`DatagramSocket`]
that was created in the setup expression, and closes it. There is no
need to remove the key/value pairs themselves from the `globals` atom
because Beat Link Trigger will reset it to hold an empty map once the
shutdown expression finishes.

[[trigger-expressions]]
== Trigger Expressions

Each trigger has its own set of expressions which can be accessed from
its <<Triggers#context-menu,context menu>>. In addition to the
`globals` atom described above, these have access to a very similar
`locals` atom which can be used to share values across expressions
within the trigger itself (but not other triggers; each gets its own
`locals` map), and individual kinds of expressions will automatically
have other values available to them which make sense in the context in
which the expression is used.

TIP: The help text below the expression editor will list and explain
the values that are automatically available for use in that kind of
expression.

=== Setup Expression

This is like the Global Setup Expression described
<<global-setup-expression,above>>, but it is used to set up the
`locals` atom, which is shared only with other expressions on the same
trigger. It is called when the trigger is loaded, and when Beat Link
Trigger starts up, after the Global Setup Expression.

To illustrate how different expressions in a trigger can work together
using `locals`, suppose you have a single trigger that wants to send
pitch information to https://resolume.com[Resolume] Arena 5 so that a
clip you are triggering runs at the same speed as the track playing on
the CDJ. Beat Link Trigger embeds Project Overtone’s
https://github.com/rosejn/osc-clj[osc-clj] library and aliases it to
`osc` within the context of expressions to make it easy to send Open
Sound Control messages. Assuming your copy of Arena 5 is running on
the same machine, and listening for OSC messages on port 9801, here is
how you could set things up so your other expressions on this trigger
can communicate with it:

```clojure
(swap! locals assoc :resolume (osc/osc-client "localhost" 9801))
```

This uses
http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/swap![`swap!`]
to modify the map in `locals` by using
http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/assoc[`assoc`]
to add the key `:resolume`, which will hold an OSC client that can be
used to send Open Sound Control messages to Arena 5 on the local
machine. See the Enabled Filter Expression <<enabled-filter-expression,below>> for
how we use it. And keep this setup in mind, because it will be
built on throughout the rest of this section.

[[shutdown-expression]]
=== Shutdown Expression

This is used to release any system resources
(open connections or files) that were allocated by the Setup
Expression. It is called when the trigger is deleted, and when Beat
Link Trigger is exiting, before the Global Shutdown Expression.

Continuing our example, here is how we would clean up the OSC client
we created to talk to Resolume when the trigger is going away:

```clojure
(osc/osc-close (:resolume @locals))
```

[[enabled-filter-expression]]
=== Enabled Filter Expression

As described in the <<overview,introduction>> to this section, this is
used when you set a trigger’s menu:Enabled[] menu to Custom. It is
called whenever a status update packet is received from a watched
player, and tells Beat Link Trigger if the trigger should be enabled
or not. Often you will want a trigger to be enabled when a DJ has
loaded a particular track, and a variety of strategies for achieving
that are described in their own <<Matching#matching-tracks,section
below>>, see that for lots of great ideas. Following some of its
suggestions, our Resolume example could enable its trigger with a
custom Enabled Filter along the lines of:

```clojure
(= track-title "Language")
```

TIP: Since this expression is called every time we get a status update from
a watched player, you might think it could be useful even when you
don’t need a custom Enabled state for the trigger, to relay ongoing
state information to other systems like Resolume. But because it is
called to decide which player to track when your trigger is set to
watch Any Player, it will be called more times than you might expect,
so there is a better expression to use for that kind of integration:
the Tracked Update Expression, discussed next.


=== Tracked Update Expression

This is similar to the Enabled Filter Expression, but even when a
trigger is configured to potentially watch multiple players, it is
called only for the player that is currently being tracked, which will
be the one that is considered “best” as described in the
<<Triggers#watch-menu,Watch Menu>> section above. Players which enable
the trigger are better than ones that don’t; within that group, it is
better to be playing, and as a tie-breaker the lowest numbered player
is chosen.

TIP: The Tracked Update expression is the ideal place to adjust the
track description displayed in the Player Status section of the
trigger by storing values in the `:track-description` and/or
`:metadata-summary` keys of the trigger locals.

Continuing our example, we can use a Tracked Update Expression to
update the playback speed within Arena 5 to stay synced with the
current tempo of the CDJ. We want to send messages to Resolume only
when the trigger is active--which means it is enabled and the player
it is watching is currently playing--so we wrap our expression in a
`when` clause like this:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(when trigger-active?  {conum-guard-clojure} <1>
  (let [pitch (/ (- pitch-multiplier 0.05) 2)]  {conum-guard-clojure} <2>
    (osc/osc-send (:resolume @locals) "/activeclip/audio/pitch/values" pitch))))  {conum-guard-clojure} <3>
----

<1> Skip this whole expression if the trigger isn’t active.

<2> We need to do a little bit of silly math because Beat Link Trigger
represents the current pitch multiplier in a fairly straightforward
way (a range where 0.0 means stopped, 1.0 means normal speed, and 2.0
means double time), while Resolume squashes that whole range into 0.0
to 1.0, slightly off-center.

<3> With that calculation accomplished, we can simply send the
appropriate OSC message to tell it the speed at which it should be
playing. (The OSC path was found by Editing the OSC Applicaton Map
within Arena 5 and clicking on the parameter I wanted to control, as
described in the
https://resolume.com/manual/en/r4/controlling#open_sound_control_osc[manual].)

There is one more improvement we can make, though. Our code as it
stands sends an OSC message to Resolume for every status packet from
the watched player, even when the pitch is not changing. That’s
inefficient; it puts needless traffic on the network, and makes
Resolume waste time processing messages that don’t change anything. By
adding a little more sophistication to our Tracked Update Expression,
we can keep track of the last value we sent to Resolume, and only send
a new one when it is different. We will use a local named
`:resolume-pitch` to keep track of the last value we sent:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(when trigger-active?  {conum-guard-clojure} <1>
  (let [pitch (/ (- pitch-multiplier 0.05) 2)]  {conum-guard-clojure} <2>
    (swap! locals update-in [:resolume-pitch]
           (fn [old-pitch]
             (when (not= pitch old-pitch)  {conum-guard-clojure} <3>
               (osc/osc-send (:resolume @locals) "/layer3/clip3/audio/pitch/values" pitch))  {conum-guard-clojure} <4>
             pitch))))  {conum-guard-clojure} <5>
----

<1> Once again we are only doing anything when the trigger is active;
the rest of the expression will be ignored otherwise.

<2> Using the math described above, we calculate the current pitch
value in the way Resolume thinks about it.

<3> We compare the current calculated pitch value with the value that
was found in the `locals` map under `:resolume-pitch` (this is the
value, if any, we most recently sent to Resolume; see step 5).

<4> Only if they are different does `osc-send` get called to notify
Resolume of the new value.

<5> Finally we store the calculated value at `:resolume-pitch` so that
it is available for comparison when we get the next status update. The
first time this runs, there will be no comparison value found in
`locals`, so we will always send an initial pitch message to Resolume
when the right track loads for the first time.

If you want to watch this happening, you can add a log statement that
will report the new pitch value each time it is sent, like this:

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(when trigger-active?
  (let [pitch (/ (- pitch-multiplier 0.05) 2)]
    (swap! locals update-in [:resolume-pitch]
           (fn [old-pitch]
             (when (not= pitch old-pitch)
               (timbre/info "New pitch:" pitch)  {conum-guard-clojure} <1>
               (osc/osc-send (:resolume @locals) "/layer3/clip3/audio/pitch/values" pitch))
             pitch))))
----

<1> Here is the log statement we are adding.

With this expression in place, when the trigger is active and you
fiddle with the Pitch fader on the CDJ that is playing the track, you
will see entries like this in the <<Debugging#logs,log file>>:

```
2016-Jul-24 23:21:31 INFO [beat-link-trigger.expressions:?] - New pitch: 0.475
2016-Jul-24 23:22:18 INFO [beat-link-trigger.expressions:?] - New pitch: 0.4782496452331543
2016-Jul-24 23:22:18 INFO [beat-link-trigger.expressions:?] - New pitch: 0.4802499771118164
```

=== Activation Expression

This is called when the trigger trips (in other words, when it would
send a MIDI message reporting that its watched player has started to
play). You can send additional MIDI messages here, or use the Clojure
and Java networking infrastructure to send a different kind of message
entirely. If this is all you want the trigger to do, you can set its
menu:Message[] menu to Custom, to suppress the default MIDI messages
that it would otherwise send.

Continuing our Resolume example, here is an Activation expression that
would use OSC to trigger the clip that our Tracked Update expression
was adjusting the pitch for:

```clojure
(osc/osc-send (:resolume @locals) "/layer3/clip3/connect/" (int 1))
```

You can also use the Activation expression to send MIDI messages that
differ from the ones available through the graphical interface. Beat
Link Trigger embeds Project Overtone’s
https://github.com/rosejn/midi-clj[midi-clj] library and aliases it to
`midi` within the context of expressions to make it easy to send MIDI
messages. The trigger’s chosen MIDI output is available as
`trigger-output` (but may be `nil` if the device is currently not
available). So as an example of how you could send a Note On message
with velocity 42 on the note and channel chosen in the trigger window:

```clojure
(when trigger-output
  (midi/midi-note-on trigger-output trigger-note 42 (dec trigger-channel)))
```

Note that the user-oriented channel number displayed in the Trigger’s
Channel menu is actually one larger than the value you actually need
to send in the MIDI protocol (Channel 1 is represented in protocol by
the number 0, and Channel 16 by the number 15, so that the channel can
fit into four bits). So you need to decrement the value of
`trigger-channel` before passing it to the midi library, as shown
above.


=== Deactivation Expression

This is called when the player that the
trigger is watching stops playing, or when the trigger becomes
disabled if it had been active. (This is when a Note Off message, or
Control Change with value zero, is sent.) You can send your own custom
messages here, much like the Activation Expression.

=== Beat Expression

This is called when any of the watched players reports the start of a
new beat. Continuing the example started in the
<<global-setup-expression,Global Setup Expression>>, here is how you
could synchronize the BPM of your ChamSys MagicQ console to the beats
coming from your CDJs. Set the trigger to watch Any Player, and then
within the Beat expression, we will react only to beat packets from
the mixer, since it will always track the master player.

NOTE: You may have realized we could also just set the trigger to
watch the Master Player, but this shows an example of how to filter
beat packets by the player number of the device sending them, and that
you get beat packets from the mixer itself too, if it is a DJM.

[source,clojure,subs=attributes+]
----
(when (= device-number 33)  {conum-guard-clojure} <1>
  (.send (:chamsys-socket @locals) (:chamsys-on @locals))  {conum-guard-clojure} <2>
  (future  {conum-guard-clojure} <3>
    (Thread/sleep (long (/ 30000 effective-tempo)))  {conum-guard-clojure} <4>
    (.send (:chamsys-socket @locals) (:chamsys-off @locals))))  {conum-guard-clojure} <5>
----

<1> After checking that the packet came from the mixer (both the DJM 900
nexus and the DJM 2000 nexus identify themselves as player number 33),

<2> we immediately send the UDP packet that tells MagicQ that the remote
trigger is on.

<3> We want to later tell it that it is off, but it is
critical that Beat Link Trigger expressions finish and return
promptly, or they will back up the whole event distribution system,
and cause other events to be delayed or lost. So we use Clojure’s
http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/future[`future`] to send a block
of code to be executed in the background on another thread.

<4> The expression will return immediately, but in the background our
inner block of code sleeps for half a beat (we calculate that by
dividing 30,000 milliseconds, or half a minute, by the number of beats
per minute that the mixer reported it is running at).

<5> When we wake up, halfway through the beat, we send the other UDP
message that tells MagicQ the remote trigger is off again. So, by
cycling those messages once per beat, the lighting console can be
driven at the same BPM as the CDJs.

[[show-shared-functions]]
== Show Shared Functions

Just like in the Triggers window, if you start writing complex
expressions in your Show, you will find yourself repeating common
pieces of code over and over again in multiple expressions. The best
way to deal with that is to pull out the repetetive part and write it
as a function, which can then be called from any expression that wants
to use it. In Clojure, you use `defn` to define a function, and
choosing menu:Tracks[Edit Shared Functions] brings up an editor window
that is where you should organize all of the shared functions you want
your Show expressions to use.

The Shared Functions will be loaded before any of your expressions are
compiled.

TIP: If you are going to be using the functions only in Triggers
expressions, define them using menu:Triggers[Edit Shared Functions] in
the Triggers window instead. Even though they get compiled into the
same `beat-link-triggers.expressions` namespace, putting them in the
Triggers window means they will be saved independently of the Show,
and will work even if the Show was never opened, or if you share the
Triggers with someone else. If you need them in both your Show and
Triggers expressions, put them in both places. Redefining a function
is harmless, although make sure you have exactly the same definition
in both places or you will confuse yourself!

TODO: Link to example, e.g. Break Buddy.

Also see the discussion of how you can <<importing-libraries,import
libraries>> for use in your expressions.

[[show-global-expressions]]
== Show Global Expressions

Starting with version 0.5 you can use <<Shows#shows,Show files>> to
more conveniently perform actions when specific sections of particular
tracks are played. Shows have their own sets of expressions, which we
cover next.

The Tracks menu at the top of a Show window lets you define three
expressions that can manage values you want to make available to all
your other expressions within the Show.

To support that, all Show expressions have access to a Clojure
http://clojure.org/reference/atoms[atom] named `globals` that is
shared with all other Show expressions, so that’s a great place to put
things for them to find. The atom starts out holding an empty
http://clojure.org/reference/data_structures#Maps[map], which allows
you to add key/value pairs to organize the information you want to
share across expressions. Show expressions also all have access to the
Triggers window globals atom, under the name `trigger-globals`.

[[show-global-setup-expression]]
=== Global Setup Expression

This is run when the Show file is opened, either because you
explicitly opened it using the Triggers window menu:File[] menu, or
because Beat Link Trigger automatically reopened it at launch because
you had it open the last time you used the program. You can use it to
open network connections or set up other values for your Track and Cue
expressions to use.

[[show-came-online-expression]]
=== Came Online Expression

This is run whenever the show is opened when Beat Link Trigger is
already connected to a DJ Link network, or if you have told it
manually to go online with the show already open. When opening the
show it will run after the <<show-global-setup-expression,Global Setup
expression>> as long as you are online. It runs by itself when you
choose menu:Network[Online?] to successfully transition from an
offline to an online state.

You have access to the show and triggers globals if you need to use
anything in them.


[[show-default-enabled-filter-expression]]
=== Default Enabled Filter Expression

The basic concept of an Enabled Filter is described in the
<<overview,introduction>> to this section; shows use them in a similar
way. Each Track that you are watching in the Show can be enabled
separately. If the track’s menu:Enabled[] menu is set to Default, that
track will look to the show itself to decide whether it should be
enabled. There is an Enabled Default menu at the top of the Show
window that is used by all tracks whose Enabled mode is Default. If
the Show’s Enabled Default is set to Custom, it will run your Default
Enabled Filter Expression to decide what to do. If your expression
returns a `true` value, all these tracks will be enabled; otherwise
they will be disabled.

Disabled Tracks do not respond to being played, and all of their
configured cues are disabled.


[[show-going-offline-expression]]
=== Going Offline Expression

This is run whenever the show is open, Beat Link Trigger was online,
and you manually take it offline by choosing menu:Network[Online?],
when you close the Show file, or exit the program. In any of the
situations where you are doing more than just going offline, it runs
right before the <<show-global-shutdown-expression,Global Shutdown
expression>>. It gives you a chance to gracefully close any
connections and release any system resources you allocated in your
<<show-came-online-expression,Came Online Expression>>.

You have access to the show and triggers globals if you need to use
anything in them.


[[show-global-shutdown-expression]]
=== Global Shutdown Expression

This is run when the Show file is closed, either because you closed
the window, or because Beat Link Trigger is shutting down. You can use
it to close any network connections or clean up any other resources
your <<show-global-setup-expression,Global Setup Expression>>
allocated.

[[show-track-expressions]]
== Show Track Expressions

Each track you add to a show can have its own set of expressions which
apply to that track, allowing you to take actions when the track is
loaded on a player, starts or stops playing, and so on. To react to
more specific regions of the track, see the
<<Expressions#show-cue-expressions,Cue Expressions, below>>.

The track expressions can be accessed from the track’s
<<Shows#track-context-menu,context menu>>. In addition to the
`globals` atom described above, these have access to a very similar
`locals` atom which can be used to share values across expressions
within the track itself (but not other tracks; each gets its own
`locals` map), and individual kinds of expressions will automatically
have other values available to them which make sense in the context in
which the expression is used.

TIP: The help text below the expression editor will list and explain
the values that are automatically available for use in that kind of
expression.

[[track-setup-expression]]
=== Setup Expression

This is run when the Show file is opened, either because you
explicitly opened it using the Triggers window menu:File[] menu, or
because Beat Link Trigger automatically reopened it at launch because
you had it open the last time you used the program. You can use it to
open network connections or set up other values for this Track and its
Cue expressions to use.

[[track-enabled-filter-expression]]
=== Enabled Filter Expression

The basic concept of an Enabled Filter is described in the
<<overview,introduction>> to this section; tracks use them in a
similar way. If the track’s menu:Enabled[] menu is set to Custom, it
will run its Enabled Filter Expression to decide what to do. If your
expression returns a `true` value, this tracks will be enabled;
otherwise it will be disabled.

Disabled Tracks do not respond to being played, and all of their
configured cues are disabled.

Note that you can also set the menu:Enabled[] menu to Default in order
to run the Show-level Default Enabled Filter as described
<<Shows#show-default-enable-filter-expression,above>>.

[[track-loaded-expression]]
=== Loaded Expression

This is called when the track is first loaded into any player. (The
same track might be loaded into multiple players at the same time;
this expression is called only when the first player loads it. The
track will continue to be considered loaded until the final player
unloads it.)

NOTE: If you want this expression to run, make sure the track’s
menu:Loaded Message[] menu is set to `Custom`.

This expression is only called when the track is enabled (disabled
tracks are not considered loaded).

[[track-playing-expression]]
=== Playing Expression

This is called when some player begins to play the track. (The same
track might be playing on multiple players at the same time; this
expression is called only when the first player starts playing it. The
track will continue to be considered playing until the final player
stops playing it.)

NOTE: If you want this expression to run, make sure the track’s
menu:Playing Message[] menu is set to `Custom`.

This expression is only called when the track is enabled (disabled
tracks are not considered to be playing).

As an example, here is a Playing Expression that would do the exact
same thing as setting the menu:Playing Message[] menu to `Note`:

[source,clojure]
----
(when midi-output
  (midi/midi-note-on midi-output playing-note 127
                     (dec playing-channel)))
----

The `(when midi-output …)` clause that wraps the `midi-note-on` call
just protects against the situation where the chosen output can’t be
found because it isn’t plugged in at the moment. Without this, the
attempt to send the note will throw an exception that gets written at
length to the log file. In the context of this Expression, the
`midi-output` variable is set to the MIDI output device chosen for the
Track, and will be `nil` if that device is not currently connected.

This uses the embedded MIDI library to send a Note On message to the
Track's chosen output device. The variable `playing-note` is set to
the note number chosen for the Track's Playing Message, `127` is the
maximum MIDI note velocity, and `playing-channel` is set to the
channel chosen for the Track, but since the user interface displays
MIDI channel numbers in the traditional user-centric range from 1 to
16, and the actual protocol requires them to be sent in the 4-bit
range 0-15, we need to subtract 1 from the variable value before
sending it, which is what the `dec` (decrement) function does.

You can tweak this to send different notes (by substituting your own
value or variable for `playing-note`) at different velocities (by
replacing the `127`) on different channels, or of course do something
else completely. The Track Stopped discussion
<<track-stopped-expression,below>> shows what you would need to set up
to emulate the other half of the `Note` mode using your own
expressions.

[[track-beat-expression]]
=== Beat Expression

Called whenever a beat packet is received from a player that is
playing this track, as long as the track is enabled.

[[track-tracked-update-expression]]
=== Tracked Update Expression

Called whenever a status update packet is received from a player that
has this track loaded, after the Enabled Filter Expression, if any,
has had a chance to decide if the track is enabled, and after the
Loaded, Playing, Stopped, or Unloaded expression, if appropriate.

If the track is not enabled, this expression is not called.

[[track-stopped-expression]]
=== Stopped Expression

This is called when the last player that had been playing the track
stops. (The same track might be playing on multiple players at the
same time; this expression is called only when the final player stops
playing it, so it is no longer playing on any player.)

NOTE: If you want this expression to run, make sure the track’s Playing
Message menu is set to `Custom`.

A track will also report stopping if it becomes disabled while it was
playing.

To complete the example introduced in the Playing Expression
<<track-playing-expression,above>>, here is an expression that sends
the same MIDI event when a track stops that you get by setting the
menu:Playing Message[] menu to `Note`:

[source,clojure]
----
(when midi-output
  (midi/midi-note-off midi-output playing-note
                     (dec playing-channel)))
----

As described in the initial example
<<track-playing-expression,above>>, this checks to be sure the MIDI
output device that has been selected for the track is currently
connected before sending it a Note Off message for the configured note
and channel. Again, you can tweak this to send different messages. For
example, you might actually want to send a different Note On message
when the track stops playing; for that, you would use the same code
shown in the <<track-playing-expression,Playing Expression>> section.

[[track-unloaded-expression]]
=== Unloaded Expression

This is called when the track is unloaded from the last player that
had loaded it. (The same track might be loaded into multiple players
at the same time; this expression is called only when the final player
unloads it, so it is no longer loaded in any player.)

NOTE: If you want this expression to run, make sure the track’s
menu:Loaded Message[] menu is set to `Custom`.

A track will also report unloading if it becomes disabled while it was
loaded.

[[track-shutdown-expression]]
=== Shutdown Expression

This is run when the Show file is closed, either because you closed
the window, or because Beat Link Trigger is shutting down. You can use
it to close any network connections or clean up any other resources
your Setup Expression allocated.

[[show-cue-expressions]]
== Show Cue Expressions

Each Cue you add to a show track can have its own set of expressions
which apply to that cue, allowing you to take actions when some player
moves into or out of that cue, if the cue starts playing on its first
beat or from some point later within the cue, or if it stops playing.

The cue expressions can be accessed from the cue’s context menu. Cues
have access to the same `globals` and `locals` atoms that track
expressions in the cue’s track do, and individual kinds of expressions
will automatically have other values available to them which make
sense in the context in which the expression is used.

TIP: The help text below the expression editor will list and explain
the values that are automatically available for use in that kind of
expression.

[[cue-entered-expression]]
=== Entered Expression

Called when the cue’s track is enabled, and the first player moves
inside the cue (in other words, the playback position of at least one
player that has the cue’s track loaded is within the beat range that
defines the cue).

NOTE: If you want this expression to run, make sure the cue’s
menu:Entered Message[] menu is set to `Custom`.

There can be multiple players inside the cue at any given moment, but
this expression will be called only when the first one enters it.

If the track is disabled, no players will be considered to be inside
any of its cues.

[[cue-started-on-beat-expression]]
=== Started On-Beat Expression

Called when the first player that is playing the track moves into the
cue, as long as it does so right at the beginning of the cue, and hits
the start of the first beat that defines the cue.

NOTE: If you want this expression to run, make sure the cue’s
menu:On-Beat Message[] menu is set to `Custom`.

There can be multiple players playing the cue at any given moment, but
this expression will be called only when the first one enters it.

If the track is disabled, no players will be considered to be playing
any of its cues.

[[cue-started-late-expression]]
=== Started Late Expression

Called when the first player that is playing the track moves into the
cue, but misses the beginning of the cue, either because the DJ jumped
into the middle of the cue, or because the player was paused somewhere
in the middle of cue and then started playing, or because the Track
was disabled when the cue was entered from the beginning and became
enabled somewhere in the middle of the cue.

NOTE: If you want this expression to run, make sure the cue’s
menu:Late Message[] menu is set to `Custom`.

There can be multiple players playing the cue at any given moment, but
this expression will be called only when the first one enters it.

If the track is disabled, no players will be considered to be playing
any of its cues.

[[cue-beat-expression]]
=== Beat Expression

Called whenever a beat packet is received from a player that is
playing inside this cue, as long as the track is enabled. (This
is not called for the first beat of the cue; when that is played,
the Started on-Beat expression is called instead.)

[[cue-tracked-update-expression]]
=== Tracked Update Expression

Called whenever a status update packet is received from a player
whose playback position is inside this cue (as long as the track
is enabled), after the Entered or Started expression, if appropriate.

[[cue-ended-expression]]
=== Ended Expression

Called when the last player that was playing the cue either leaves it
or stops playing. There can be multiple players playing the cue at any
given moment, and this expression will be called as soon as there are
none left.

NOTE: For this expression to run for cues that started on time, the
menu:On-Beat Message[] menu needs to be set to `Custom`. Similarly, if
you want it to run for cues that started late, the Late Message menu
must be set to `Custom`. If you are using custom messages for both
situations and you need to be able to tell them apart, have the
Started On-Beat and Started Late expressions each set a different
value in an expression local to let you know which ran.

If the track becomes disabled while it was playing this cue, this
expression will be called at that point as well.

[[cue-exited-expression]]
=== Exited Expression

Called when the last player that was inside the cue leaves it. There
can be multiple players positioned in the cue at any given moment, and
this expression will be called as soon as there are none left.

NOTE: If you want this expression to run, make sure the cue’s
menu:Entered Message[] menu is set to `Custom`.

If the track becomes disabled while there were players positioned
inside this cue, this expression will be called at that point as well.

> If you came here from the link in the first [DJ TechTools article](http://djtechtools.com/2017/07/19/decoding-pioneer-pro-link-connect-cdjs-ableton-link/), please look at my [instructions](https://github.com/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger#beat-link-trigger) for more information about how to install and use Beat Link Trigger!

## What to Download

- If you already have a compatible Java runtime installed (Java 11 or later), you can just download the executable cross-platform Jar file, and should be able to run it by double-clicking.
- If you are on a Mac and don’t want to have to worry about installing and managing a separate Java environment, you can download the MacOS disk image (`.dmg`) file, which contains a signed, notarized Mac application with the necessary Java runtime built right in.
- If you are on 64-bit Windows and don’t want to have to separately install Java you can download the Win64 MSI installer (`.msi` file), which installs a Windows application with the Java runtime built in.
- If you want to test [what is going into the next release](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link-trigger/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), look at the pre-release SNAPSHOT release (if any) at the [top of the full Releases list](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link-trigger/releases).

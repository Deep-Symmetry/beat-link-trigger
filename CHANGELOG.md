## [Unreleased][unreleased]

### Added

- A status summary of the selected player is shown after the menu.
- You can now open multiple trigger windows using the new Window menu,
  and have each watching a different player and sending a different
  MIDI message. Closing the last window quits.
- A first-stage loading process which checks the Java version and
  presents an error dialog if it is too old to successfully load the
  rest of the application, offering to open the download page.

### Changed

- The MIDI Output menu now reformats names so you don't need to see
  the CoreMIDI4J prefix even when it is in use.
- The Player menu stores its choices in a format that is more
  efficient for comparing with the incoming player packets.

### Fixed

- Moved all interaction with UI objects to the AWT Event Dispatch
  thread; we were trying to get the current output menu selection on
  the MIDI event thread, which was causing a
  ConcurrentModificationException within AWT.
- Keep track of MIDI outputs as we open them, so we can reuse the same
  instance rather than creating new outputs every time. Clean them up
  when they disappear from the MIDI environment, like Afterglow does.

## 0.1.0 - 2016-05-13

### Added

- Set up initial project structure.
- Selector to choose MIDI output as trigger destination.

# beat-link-trigger

A simple application to trigger a MIDI event when a CDJ starts
playing, as an example of how to work with
[beat-link](https://github.com/brunchboy/beat-link#beat-link).

## Usage

Once released, you will be able to just download the jar file and
double-click it to run it. For now, you will need to build it yourself
using Leiningen, or run it interactively in a Leiningen repl.

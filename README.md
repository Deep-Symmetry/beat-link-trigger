# beat-link-trigger

A simple application to trigger a MIDI event when a CDJ starts
playing, as an example of how to work with
[beat-link](https://github.com/brunchboy/beat-link#beat-link).

## Usage

Download the latest executable `beat-link-trigger.jar` file from the
[releases] page and double-click it to run it. If that doesn&rsquo;t
work, make sure you have a recent
